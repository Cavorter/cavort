    Yesterday was a very good soda day. Jennifer arrived for our usual date night with my birthday present a few days early: A mixed case of <a href="http://www.drinksopranos.com/">The Sopranos soda</a>. (Do follow that link and make sure to watch the commercial, it's fairly funny. The timing is a bit off but it works.) I'm drinking my first bottle of the Limoncello right now, and it's pretty good if a touch more sweet than I necessarily like. The good news is that it isn't a cloying sweet, it's very clean and finishes exceptionally well. I have a bottle of the Chianti with me at work today as well and I'm hoping it's at least as good.
  
  
  
    After we had a nice walk around the trails at <a href="http://www.woodlakenaturecenter.org/">Wood Lake Nature Center</a> and then taking a <a href="http://www.kia.com/rondo/rondoism/">Kia Rondo</a> out for a test drive we stopped in at the original <a href="http://www.chatterboxpub.net/">Chatterbox Pub</a> where I noticed for the first time that they had a "Scratch" Ginger Ale which turned out to be very good. It is definitely a Ginger Ale and not a Ginger Beer since it does go for more of the sweet than the hot and spicy, but it also has a really wonderful clove flavor that adds a lot of depth and character. Very highly recommended.
