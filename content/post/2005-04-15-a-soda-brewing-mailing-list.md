    Back in January I was playing around with the updated Google Groups and had created a group just to see what the management options were like. Well, one thing led to another and I never got back to playing with it for whatever reason.
  
  
  
    Fast forward almost 3 months and there are actually people subscribed to the group! Who'd of thunk it, eh? :-)
  
  
  
    Anyway, if you want to participate in the very beginning of what I hope can be come yet another resource for soda brewers on the net, please take a look at <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/Soda-Brewing">Google Groups Soda-Brewing</a>
