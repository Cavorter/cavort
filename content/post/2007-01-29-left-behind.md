    So in a pretty quick turn of events, my main character in World of Warcraft has been stranded on one server while my guild left for another one.
  
  
  
    Somewhat surprisingly, I'm only a little irritated with the guild. I had only recently come back after a very long hiatus and most of the current members of the guild I do not even know. Still, it was quite a shock to login after only being off for just over a week because I was busy with real life to find all of the old trusty guild stuff suddenly unavailable.
  
  
  
    Now I am trying to figure out what to do. I missed out on the free realm transfers and my petition to get a free one was denied. I could pay to have the character moved to the same server as the rest of the guild, but I really don't know if I want to bother. Several of the people that went on hiatus from WoW about the same time that I did are going to be in the same situation if they do decide to come back, but I really am not sure how likely that is with many of them and am pretty sure it's not going to happen with several others.
