    I just finished up "A King of Infinite Space" by <a href="http://www.allensteele.com/index.html">Allen Steele</a>. I've been working through his bibliography since late last year and I think that while this is not my most favorite of his books yet, it was still definitely worth reading.
  
  
  
    I think I just couldn't get his resolution to quite fit the story that I had been reading. It's not quite the wrong ending for the story, there were just some details that didn't seem to work quite correctly.
