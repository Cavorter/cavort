Normally I have 4 tabs open in Firefox all day long. One for Gmail, one for Google Reader, and then two for L-Space with one for System Status to keep me logged in and another for actually reading the message base. Today I have only have two open since I shut down L-Space last night, and it's odd how small the tab strip looks and how I keep on wanting to click through more tabs than I can. It's almost muscle memory of how to change through the tabs at this point.

Okay, maybe I'm not making any sense. Simple version: It's odd not being logged into L-Space today. More odd than I expected.
