My office has been in the middle of a bit of an extended shuffle since the beginning of the year. Some people were going to be moving, then they were not going to be moving, then moving to another building, then my group was going to move in July, then in June, then the following week, then 3 weeks later. That last one was finally correct and we've been up on the 5th floor for about 2 and a half weeks. While I didn't get a window cube, I do get quite a view out through a couple of other people's cubes which really is almost as good.
  
A few minutes ago my manager dropped by, we're moving again. Down to the 3rd floor, which doesn't feel quite as glamorous for some reason, but we're getting window cubes. ETA, first week of June. I suppose we'll just have to see what happens.
