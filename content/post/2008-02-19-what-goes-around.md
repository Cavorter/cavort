    I just had another experience that is fully indicative of why I really need to find a new job.
  
  
  
    I was in a meeting this morning and asked a question about the status of a project that I am not involved with. No one in the meeting knew the answer to the question but someone took an action item to ask someone else that they knew was managing the project about the status. Reconstructing the sequence of events from the email chain that person did ask the person they knew who sent email to someone else who forwarded the email to someone on my team who forwarded it on to someone else on my team who then asked me what the status on this project was.
  
  
  
    Crying. Laughing. Both good options here.
