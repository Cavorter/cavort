    To those of you with my home telephone number I will be disconnecting that line sometime this week most likely permanently. Due to the kindness of a good friend I've got a free cell phone for quite awhile and now that the Minneapolis Municipal WiFi is working great I have no need of DSL service which is a great opportunity to remove a monthly bill from my budget.
  
  
  
    If you don't have my cell number contact me through the usual methods and I'll be sure to get it to you.
