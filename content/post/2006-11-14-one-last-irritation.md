    While I was uninstalling the Zune software from my system a thought occurred to me: I did not remember ever seeing an option of where to install the software during installation. Since the uninstallation was nice and painless I decided to restart the installation to verify my memory just to be sure and I could not find a way for an average user to change the installation location of the software.<br /> So there's one more reason to stay away for now.
