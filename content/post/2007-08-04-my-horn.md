    While I'm on the topic, I should mention the details about my horn.
  
  
  
    A few years ago after searching for a few months I came across a used four valve front bell American Euphonium that was in decent shape (Lots of scratches, some dents, lacquer is very worn but largely intact) for a remarkably good price. The sound isn't as good as the Yamaha YEP-321S I played in college but for less than $500 it is certainly good enough. Nicely wide though just a touch breathy.
  
  
  
    Anyway, this morning I finally ran down the serial number (237531) and bell markings and I've found out that it is a <a href="http://contemporacorner.com/baritones1.html">F.A. Reynolds Contempora BR-06 4-Valve Baritone</a> manufactured in <a href="http://www.musictrader.com/olds.html">1967</a> in <a href="http://contemporacorner.com/serial1.html">Abiline, TX</a>.
  
  
  
    I'm actually wondering a bit if some of the breathy sound may be from the mouthpiece I'm using right now, which is a Bach 6 1/2 AL. It's a lot more like the Bach 12C that I remember playing on in high school than the shallow mouthpiece that came with it. I need to do some more research about the topic.
