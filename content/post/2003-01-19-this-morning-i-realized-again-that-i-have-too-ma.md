This morning I realized, again, that I have too many hobbies. I really wonder if I sometimes really get paralyzed by the number of things that I _could_ be doing. Work is easier, there is a defined goal that I need to work for generally so it's easy to just keep plugging away until it gets done. There will always be other goals to work toward at work.

At home how many solid goals do I really have that I work toward? Most of them really do not have any deadlines, they just exist as things that I should probably get around to someday.

Dunno what it means, but self awareness is possibly one of those goals that I do like to work towards. Or at least an illusion of self-awareness anyway.
