    Despite a fairly busy and somewhat inflexible layout, <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com">DailyMotion</a> seems to have a really nice feature set. However my attempts to post through their "Post to Blog" feature rather than copy/paste the string into my own software doesn't quite seem to be working with my installation of WordPress at the moment. <strong>Update:</strong> It actually appears that it did post successfully every single time, but was showing an error on the DailyMotion side of things. Kind of odd. I've left the best of those three attempts in place.
