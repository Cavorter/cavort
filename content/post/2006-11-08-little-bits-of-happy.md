    While I'm certainly not entirely happy with the results of the elections yesterday, <a href="http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061108/NEWS/611080394/1002" target="_blank">the election of a socialist to the US Senate in Vermont</a> makes my little socialist heart very happy.
