    I finished watching Lost Season 2 on DVD (out from Netflix) last night, or all of the episodes anyway. (I didn't realize disc 7 was just extras until I watched the last episode on disc 6 last night which was very obviously a cliffhanger.)
  
  
  
    I had talked with <a href="http://resolute.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">a friend</a> about it just as the first disc was arriving and she had mentioned that she wasn't interested in seeing Season 2 because she was apparantly tired of the&nbsp;neverending slow reveal of mysteries paired with just a bit too much posing. I just wanted to know what was in the hatch.
  
  
  
    Honestly, I almost agreed with her when I had finished the first of six discs of episodes. Specifically episodes 1-3 where, I think, possibly the most grotesquely painful replaying of the same 10 minutes of footage that I have ever seen on television. Yes, the hatch opening was a big deal for the series but you don't spend <em>three entire episodes</em> without moving on to <em>something</em>, <strong><em>ANYTHING</em></strong>, else.
  
  
  
    The good news? As soon as they got over themselves and got on with the rest of the season things took off very&nbsp;nicely and I really think there was enough balance of interesting new mysteries along with answers for the old mysteries even if not complete, and usually leading to new mysteries. The last episode of Season 2 alone was a great payoff for answering quite a few issues and I was reasonably happy with most, thought not all, of the answers.
  
  
  
    Was there still maybe a whole lot of posing? Hell yes, but I think there may have been slightly less than in Season 1. I also had some small issues with the overly melodramatic continuing epic saga of the stunning and dramatic love triangle supreme of all time, space, and eternity that is Sawyer, Kate, and Jack's story of love, unrequited and not, spurned and returned, and flowing through the, well, you get the idea. It runs on even worse than that last sentence. Possibly the most irritating thing about it though is that I think I might know people just like that.
  
  
  
    Maybe I'm just a sucker for neverending plot lines, my 85% complete run of the Avengers comic from Marvel not being another indication, but I thought it was fun and it succeeded just as well as Season 1 at making me nervous to be alone in the dark after the TV had been turned off.
