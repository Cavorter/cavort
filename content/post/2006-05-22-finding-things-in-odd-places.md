I read a fair number of different blogs and news sources and recently added a whole slew of feeds when I recently bought an XBox 360. This morning, I read on one of those news feeds news about the company I work for: <a href="http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/10999/DK-is-the-New-Home-for-BradyGames/">DK is the New Home for BradyGames</a>.

Unfortunately I've never seen software up in the employee "bookstore".
