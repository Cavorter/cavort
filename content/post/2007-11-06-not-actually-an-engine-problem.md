    Thank goodness for the <a href="http://www.tdiclub.com/TDIFAQ">FAQ at TDiClub</a>. Last week-ish the glowplug light in my 2003 VW Golf TDi started flashing but performance didn't seem to be effected at all and the car was starting fine and everything seemed kosher so I figured it could wait to get taken care of. Last night on the way home I had a fairly close call in traffic (Funny how bad traffic during rush hour on the first night of Daylight Savings Time almost always is) and noticed something odd while staring at my rear-view mirror hoping that the person behind me was going to miss: I didn't see a reflection of my brake lights on the other car.
  
  
  
    After getting home safely with the garage door closed I was able to verify that except for the roof light the brake lights were totally DOA. Went inside and checked the TDiClub FAQ and sure enough <a href="http://tdiclub.com/TDIFAQ/TDiFAQ-8.html#d">there was entry (8.d. third item down)</a> Brake lights!
  
  
  
    The irritating thing? Why was there no helpful police people to tell me my brake lights weren't functional all week long until I was on the three and a half block drive up to the auto parts store? Thankfully they believed me when I said I was literally on my way up the street to get new bulbs (and followed me just to make sure). Gr.
