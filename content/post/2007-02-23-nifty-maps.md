    The Weather Channel has some really cool new <a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/map/interactive/">interactive maps</a> that overlay current weather information (including animation) on top of Microsoft Virtual Earth maps. Being able to dynamically change the map while the live radar and/or satellite information is being displayed is possibly one of the best uses I have seen yet for the new Ajax style map products.
