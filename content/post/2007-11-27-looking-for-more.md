    One of the things that I like about the <a href="http://www.zune.net">Zune</a> is that it has podcast support that is more like how I really use them rather than the way they work with iTunes. It's not perfect by any stretch (Why can't I squirt a podcast?) but it's generally very good. Good enough that I'm looking for more content to listen to.
  
  
  
    I have two very different kinds of podcasts that I listen to for very different environments. I find that I can't listen to people talking without having to pay attention to them, at least if I want to get anything out of it. This is just as true of talk radio as it is of audio books. I also find that after 45 minutes of people yakking I get really, really bored pretty quickly but I find items less than 10min long to not be worth the effort to fiddle with the player to listen to (Not perfect #2: Can't put them in playlists). Which is really unfortunate since I otherwise would have a couple of really short items that I do like (<a href="http://www.uh.edu/engines/">The Engines of Our Ingenuity</a> being a prime example).
  
  
  
    So here's what I'm currently listening to:
  
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://brasscast.com/">BrassCast</a> (Brass band music)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://podcasts.thestranger.com/savagelove/">Savage LoveCast</a> (Dan Savage)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/">Major Nelson</a> (Xbox gaming. I often end up fast forwarding through much of it)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://podcasts.thestranger.com/dear_science">Dear Science</a> (Science commentary. Deciding if I'm going to keep it.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://cartalk.com/">Car Talk</a> (NPR show)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.thislife.org/">This American Life</a> (NPR show)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/">Wait Wait Don't Tell Me</a> (NPR show)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://twit.tv/ww">Windows Weekly</a> (Tech news)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/">Radio Lab</a> (NPR show)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://tmbg.com">They Might Be Giants</a> (Oddities and live stuff from the band
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.startribune.com/counterintelligence/">Counter Intelligence</a> (Star Tribune dining and food podcast)
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  
    I also really used to love <a href="http://www.spacemusic.nl/Podcast.html">SpaceMusic</a>, but that shifted to a paid subscription model a year or so ago. Though looking on the site now there does appear to be some free stuff again so maybe I'll take a look at them again.
  
  
  
    Any suggestions anyone?
