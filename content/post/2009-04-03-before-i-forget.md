    Had been intending to post this for awhile, but I'll just clip down a bit and get this chunk out there at least.
  
  
  
    In the last big snowstorm I ended up with a pretty hefty ding and honestly had a great experience with <a href="http://www.progressive.com/">Progressive</a> getting it repaired. The whole thing was fast, easy, and relatively cheap. Bonus: due to the nature of the ding it didn't even mess with my insurance rates.
  
  
  
    The only downside of the insurance thing was that I had a <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/pontiac/g6/2008/review.html">2008 Pontiac G6 GT</a> for 6 days while my car was in the shop. I think the most positive thing that I can say about that thing was that it sure did go fast in a straight line. Otherwise the controls were just all around bad, especially seat adjustment. Badly placed, bad quality (felt like I was going to break the seat height adjustment just touching it), and just over all irritating. I also just couldn't get comfortable in the thing. The seating felt like it was designed to have me lying on my back the whole time and resisted any effort to sit otherwise. Don't even get me started on the enormous blindspot caused by the front right pillar.
