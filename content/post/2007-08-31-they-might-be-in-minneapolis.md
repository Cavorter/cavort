    <a href="http://www.tmbg.com/indexa.html">They Might Be Giants</a> are touring in support of their <a href="http://theymightbegiants.com/index.html">new, very good, album "The Else"</a> and will be <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/06003EF3B65691F1?artistid=736288&#038;majorcatid=10001&#038;minorcatid=60">in Minneapolis on September 19th at First Ave</a>. (Which is a Monday and the TBA opening act starts at 9PM so likely to be a pretty late night)
  
  
  
    Anyone want to go?
