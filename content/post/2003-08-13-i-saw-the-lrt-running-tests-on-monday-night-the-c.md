    I saw the <a href="http://www.metrocouncil.org/transportation/lrt/lrt.htm">LRT</a> running tests on Monday night! The car is a bit shorter than I had thought it would be, but makes sense given they will be running every 15min. Things are still on target for opening the line early next year, and from the visible progress being made I don't doubt that at all.
