    I just got a fairly unexpected email: NCSoft has reactivated my <a href="http://www.cityofheroes.com" target="_blank">City of Heroes</a>/<a href="http://www.cityofvillains.com" target="_blank">City of Villains</a> account for the weekend. It seems that they are launching a new retail combo-box of both&nbsp;editions of the game (Available only at that bastion of&nbsp;retail hell: Walmart)&nbsp;and want to try and get lapsed players, like myself, back into the game.
  
  
  
    That was kind of cool, and I might take them up on it and log back in to take a look around if it doesn't take too long to reinstall the game, but the item that I thought was really cool was the <a href="http://www.cityofheroes.com/community/veteranrewards.html" target="_blank">Veteran Rewards</a> system that they touted in the same message.
  
  
  
    Essentially, the longer you have an active account in the game the more cool stuff you get with your characters. I honestly have no idea how Blizzard could do something similar with WoW but I would love to see it happen.
