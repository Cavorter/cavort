    I finally got around to taking Transit to work this morning rather than driving. It's been a long time coming and I've admittedly been just really damn lazy about it. It was a beautiful morning for it. A nice few blocks walk to the train platform in the rising sun and nicely crisp air and a nice ride on both the train and the bus. The only big downside? Everyone else who was waiting for the bus at MOA was smoking. Gr.
  
  
  
    Still, total transit time was just about 1.5 hours, which certainly isn't quick (~3-4 times what it takes me to drive at the same time of day) but it did allow for quite a bit of thinking and reading time which is something I don't necessarily get if I'm driving.
