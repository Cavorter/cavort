While I'm thinking about it, I thought that I would mention that the 360 that I did buy is obviously part of the first refresh since it did not contain the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/systemsetup/xbox360/accessories/mediaremote.htm">Xbox 360 Media Remote</a> that was a "promotional item" from the original shipment. Too bad really, I hadn't known that it was not in the recent shipments so I was surprised not to see one in the box. Ah well.
