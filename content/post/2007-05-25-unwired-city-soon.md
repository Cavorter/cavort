    According to <a href="http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/wirelessminneapolis/WirelessMapTimeline_Jan07.pdf">this document</a> I should be able to use the <a href="http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/wirelessminneapolis/">city of Minneapolis' new wifi network</a> by the end of the summer. It will be very interesting to see how it competes with my current DSL connection from Qwest.
