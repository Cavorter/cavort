On Monday (Dec 31), Betsy and I stopped by the Toyota dealer and picked up her new car. It's a gorgeous blue [Toyota Prius](http://prius.toyota.com). So far, we're really happy with it. There aren't many options available for it, so we basically took almost all of them:
  
 - 6 disc CD Changer
 - Onboard GPS/Navigation System
 - Alloy Wheels
 - A/C
 - Cruise Control
 - Floor Mats
 - Cargo Net for the trunk

There are quite a few things to get used to with it though since it is a Gas/Electric Hybrid. The strangest thing is sitting at a stop light or stop sign and realizing that the engine just shut off, on purpose. Then when you need to go, just step on the gas and there isn't any hesitation. It recharges the battery array (38 NiMH batteries in a big long box in the trunk) mostly while braking and I have noticed some small oddities while braking. The problem is that I don't know if that's the Hybrid System or if it's the ABS system, since I've never driven a car with either before.

I do have to say that I _Love_ being an early adopter!
