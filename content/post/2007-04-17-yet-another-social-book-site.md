    Not that the books themselves are social, though I can think of a few fictional libraries where that might be true, but <a href="http://www.revish.com/">Revish</a> is yet another social website with a focus on books. In some ways it's closer to what I've been looking for than the other ones I've <a href="http://www.cavort.org/2007/03/17/too-bad-about-the-name-but/">seen</a> http://www.cavort.org/2007/02/21/while-im-thinking-about-books/. In any case, I have a <a href="http://www.revish.com/people/Cavorter/">profile there too now</a>.
