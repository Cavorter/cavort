So I think that I have found what I would like to replace my <a href="http://www.handspring.com/products/visorplatinum/index.jhtml?sub_nav_section=Overview&#038;prod_cat_name=Plat">Handspring Visor Platinum<a /> with: The </a><a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/iQue3600/">Garmin iQue 3600</a>. It's about the same size and weight as my existing Visor, has a much better screen, still uses grafitti unlike a lot of the other new Palm OS devices, has a built in GPS, and has an SD expansion slot.

The only problem is that in order to adequately use the GPS, you really have to have a fairly large SD memory card to hold the geographical data, but since I also want Bluetooh in my next handheld I wouldn't be able to use both the really nice integrated GPS functions at the same time! There is a rumor that they will be announcing another version in the next year or so that will have Bluetooth, so maybe just sitting tight and waiting for a bit will be just the right thing to do.
