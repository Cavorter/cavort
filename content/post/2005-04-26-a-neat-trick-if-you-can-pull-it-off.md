    A friend recently posted on L-Space the following message:
  
  
  
    Tired of speeding tickets?<br /> Want to open up spaces between you and the cars around you?
  
  
  
    Step 1. Tie <a href="http://img.engadget.com/common/images/7291976886464954.JPG?0.9341875457336202">these balloons</a> to your car<br /> Step 2. Drive VERY FAST.<br /> Step 3. Watch people freak out<br /> Step 4. Tell the officer you thought they were real!
