    <a href="http://www.bevnet.com/reviews/drysoda/" target="_blank">BevNet has a fairly positive review</a> up of a new line of sodas with some fairly interesting flavors: Rhubarb, Lavender, Lemongrass, and Kumquat. The brand is called <a href="http://www.drysoda.com/" target="_blank">DRY Soda</a>, and I only wish I could get some locally. With a mixed-case price starting at $25, plus shipping, I think I'm going to have to wait a bit before I get to try it.
  
  
  
    I've actually been thinking that the people behind Snow would do a fabulous job with lavendar flavored soda.
