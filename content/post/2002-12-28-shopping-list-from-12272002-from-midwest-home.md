**Shopping List from 12/27/2002**:<br /> _from [Midwest Homebrewing and Winemaking Supplies](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/)_

Item | Catalog# | Qty | Price | Total
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Large Tea/Herb Ball | #6301 | 1 | $4.25 | $4.25
Rubber stoppers for the Carboy | unlisted | 2 | $0.99 | $1.98
&nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | **Total** | $6.23
  
There's always something to be said about convenience. Midwest is right on my way home from work and it just makes it easy to stop there for supplies that I know they have. 2 Stoppers are better than one since I think we all know how likely it is that I'll loose one of them in the next month or so.
