    A friend who knows me well got a four pack of the "treat-sized" Jones Candy Corn soda and brought it in to work for me today. Good thing since I had not been able to find it at my local Target. A couple of notes:
  
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      It is Yellow. (FD&C Yellow no. 5 to be specific)
    </li>
    <li>
      It smells exactly like good fresh candy corn.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is as or more sweet than candy corn
    </li>
    <li>
      It is <em>really</em> yellow.
    </li>
    <li>
      The flavor is not quite perfect, but in some ways that's a good thing since it has some nice orange notes that keep it from being a complete sugar bomb.
    </li>
    <li>
      Did I mention "yellow"?
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  
    Anyway, fun stuff. Not recomended for daily drinking. Though if you can find some of their other holiday flavor, "Monster Mojito", buy a case. It's great stuff and this year's cane sugar can only have improved it over last year.
