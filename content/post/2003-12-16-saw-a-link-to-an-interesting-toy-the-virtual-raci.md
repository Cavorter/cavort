    Saw a link to an interesting toy: <a href="http://www.bobearlracing.com/Index.htm">The Virtual Racing Chassis</a> Basically a guy built a chair formed kind of like a Formula 1 driving seat for racing games. Pretty cool, and I wouldn't mind having one myself. Not badly priced at $299 either! Now if it had hydraulic force feedback effects too:. Well, then it wouldn't cost $299, would it.
