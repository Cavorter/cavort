    <a target="_blank" href="http://amblypygid.livejournal.com">Amblypygid</a> and I just got back from taking the kids to see the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.firehallmuseum.org/">Firefighters Hall and Museum (IE Only)</a> in NE Mpls. One of the volunteers gave us an excellent guided tour showing off all of their ten antique and otherwise old fire trucks, spanning everything from hand carried and pumped to semi-modern diesel engines and all the equipment to go along with it. All of the equipment is restored and being kept in excellent condition.
  
  
  
    Possible the most interesting part of the tour, from a tech geek perspective, was the working municipal fire alarm telegraph system that they let you actually pull the alarm and see the system in action. It's so easy to forget how many of the problems that we have solved with radio communications were solved miles of wire and big batteries before wireless solutions really became feasible.
  
  
  
    Very highly recommended, and they also have a quite nice hall for rent as well.
