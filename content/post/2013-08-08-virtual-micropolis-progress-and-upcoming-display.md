    <a title="Introducing Virtual Micropolis" href="http://www.cavort.org/2013/03/24/introducing-virtual-micropolis/" target="_blank">I mentioned back in March</a> that I had started working on a wiki to provide further information about our Micropolis modules and I am fairly proud to say that we're definitely making progress on filling the site with content. It's not complete yet, by any stretch of the imagination, but it's got a good base of content and the visual style is starting to come together as well.
  
  
  
    If you haven't had a chance to look at it, or you haven't looked since last March, now is a great time to go take a peek at http://www.virtualmicropolis.com and you can get updates by subscribing to any of the RSS feeds on the site or by following the Mayor's twitter feed <a href="http://twitter.com/vmicropolis" target="_blank">@vmicropolis</a>!
  
  
  
    We have also been invited back to the Saint Anthony Park Library to display our layout as part of their post-renovation grand re-opening party! If you missed the display in March this is a great time to come out and have a look at our layout with some additional modules by Thomas Anderson. Plus Peter Hoh is returning with his educational models, the travelling DK Books display for their Star Wars LEGO books we be on hand, at least one stormtrooper from the local 501st, and refreshments provided by the little grocery store up the street! Mark your calendars for Wednesday August 14, 2013 from 6-8pm and be sure to tell anyone else who likes LEGO.
