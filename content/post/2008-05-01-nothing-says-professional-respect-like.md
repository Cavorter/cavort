    On one of the mailing lists that I am on there are occasional requests for consultants or work-for-hire type jobs. This morning I saw one that looked vaguely interesting until I got to the second paragraph, reprinted here for your enjoyment:
  
  
  <blockquote>
    
      Our environment is a bit unusual, so you have to be willing to help us do some things that may not be the most 'recommended' practices for installers &#8212; while we're totally interested in hearing about best practices, you must understand that our needs may dictate doing things in a less than traditional way, and you must be willing to bow to the will of our users.
    
  </blockquote>
  
  
    Um, I'm thinking that sounds about as fun as getting a root canal. I sure hope that person does not think they do a good job recruiting. On the other hand they get points for honesty.
