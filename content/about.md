My name is Nathan Stohlmann and I am a computer geek specializing in software automation and related engineering. Some might use the current hot buzzword "DevOps". This is a skill set and focus that developed out of the 15 years that designed scripted and Windows Installer based installation packages. Over time I took over the build automation for many of the products I was packaging and the logical next move was to do the end-to-end automation for the projects that did not require conventional installers as well. My current application expertise is with software and infrastructure automation tools, expecially PowerShell.

I am currently working for <a href="http://www.verifybrand.com">Verify Brand</a> and am very happy there. I essentially get to write PowerShell all day and automate everything for a great group of people.

I am a fan of <a href="http://www.lego.com">LEGO bricks</a> and enjoy building with my modest (by some pretty odd standards) collection of parts. I am active in TwinLUG, a Twin Cities local LEGO User Group (LUG), and maintain the group's web presence at <a href="http://www.twinlug.org">twinlug.org</a>. I once said I was primarily a Technic builder but over the past 6 years or so have spent most of my time working on contributions to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1148237@N21/">Micropolis</a> and maintain the <a href="http://twinlug.com/micropolis-micro-city-standard/">official specification</a>. IÂ have also started another site, <a href="http://virtualmicropolis.com" target="_blank">Virtual Micropolis</a>, just to document me and my partner's growing collection of modules.

I am an amateur musician. I formerly played Euphonium with the <a href="http://www.calhounislesband.org/" target="_blank">Calhoun-Isles Community Band</a> and am trying to figure out how to add them or a different community band back into my schedule. I used to sing Baritone with <a href="http://ovmc.org" target="_blank">One Voice Mixed Chorus</a>, a nationally recognized LGBTQA choir. You can also almost always find me at one or more <a href="http://tubachristmas.com" target="_blank">TubaChristmas</a> performances every year.

A note about spam that appears to have come from my domain, cavort.org. It appears that at least one spammer has been using various addresses @cavort.org as the purported sender of the messages. Please believe me when I say that if I could have that person in this room right now they would leave the room with an extremely funny walk. I do not send spam. This domain has never sent spam. It's not me and I am terribly sorry if you got crap from those shmucks, but there is absolutely nothing that I can do about it at this point.

If you wish to contact me please use my first name at virtualmicropolis.com or through <a href="http://twitter.com/cavorter" target="_blank">twitter</a>.
