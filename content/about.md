My name is Nathan Stohlmann and I am a computer geek specializing in software automation and related engineering. Some might use the current hot buzzword "DevOps". This is a skill set and focus that developed out of the 15 years when I designed and scripted Windows Installer based installation packages. Over time I took over the build automation for many of the products I was packaging and the logical next move was to do the end-to-end automation for the projects that did not require conventional installers as well. My current application expertise is with software and infrastructure automation tools, especially PowerShell.

I am currently working for [Aspenware](https://aspenware.com) as a Senior DevOps Engineer on a very small DevOps team. The company is a nice return to something similar to a previous job at [Verify Brand](http://www.verifybrand.com) where I essentially got to write PowerShell all day and automate everything. My luck at working with pretty good people continues.

I am a fan of [LEGO bricks](http://www.lego.com) and enjoy building with my modest (by some pretty odd standards) collection of parts. I am active in TwinLUG, a Twin Cities local LEGO User Group (LUG), and maintain the group's web presence at [http://www.twinlug.org](twinlug.org). I once said I was primarily a Technic builder but over the past decade+ have spent most of my time working on contributions to [Micropolis](http://www.flickr.com/groups/1148237@N21/) and maintain the [official specification](http://twinlug.com/micropolis-micro-city-standard/). A number of years ago I also started another site, [Virtual Micropolis](http://virtualmicropolis.com), just to document me and my partner's growing collection of modules. It is unfortunately very out of date and needs to be rebuilt from scratch.

I am an amateur musician. I formerly played Euphonium with a local community band and am trying to figure out how to add them or a different community band back into my schedule. I used to sing Baritone with [One Voice Mixed Chorus](http://ovmc.org), a nationally recognized LGBTQA choir. You can also almost always find me at one or more [TubaChristmas](http://tubachristmas.com) performances every year.
