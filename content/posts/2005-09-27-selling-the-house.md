I decided very late last week that I am just too lazy to be a landlord, and so I am going to sell my duplex in South Minneapolis in the next 6 months. Hopefully somewhat sooner than later but we'll see what happens. I have to finish a couple of projects before I can put it on the market, and I want to see what market conditions are like as well. It is, however, going to happen.

Speaking of the projects, if anyone knows anything about installing auxilliary heating systems like baseboard heaters please get ahold of me!
