[Target's](http://www.target.com) Archer Farms line of food products now has a "premium" soda available, at least in the Twin Cities market. I saw 4 flavors today at a non-SuperTarget close to work: Sarsparilla, Ginger Beer, Strawberry Creme, and Diet Peach. I picked up a 4pack of all but the Diet and should have had a chance to taste all of them by the weekend. The ingredients do list sugar instead of HFCS, so I have some hope that it might be at least drinkable and if it's done by the same people who make their "Italian Soda" line of beverages there's a strong chance there will be at least one good flavor in there.
