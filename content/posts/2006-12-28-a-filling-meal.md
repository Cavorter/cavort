    FYI - If you have never made oatmeal out of a canister before (I've been having a packet of the instant varieties most mornings for the past 2 years) learn from my folly: Be sure that you figure out which ingredient is which measurement. Quaker Oats, somewhat differently expected, does <em>not</em> list the oats as the first ingredient in the cooking directions table. But I should be very full by the time I'm done with this at least. :-)
