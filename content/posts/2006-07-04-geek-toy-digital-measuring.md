    I saw [a post on Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/sticky-yard-digital-measuring-system-184515.php) while digging through my holiday weekend backlog of a really cool new toy that I'm really tempted to get: [The Sticky Yard Digital Measurement System](http://www.stickyard.com/).
  
  
  
    You stick an adhesive or magnetic custom yard stick to an object, take a picture, process it with their software, and can get accurate measurements of anything in the picture.
  
  
  
    How cool is that!
