After a few years of owning the domain name, I am finally getting off my proverbial butt and doing something with <a href="http://virtualmicropolis.com">VirtualMicropolis.com</a>. My original idea had been, as is somewhat usual for me, a bit grandiose. I was going to get the spec moved over there and make it a community for everyone who built Micropolis to come and post their stuff. Because there aren't any <em>other</em> places on the Internet to build a community (like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1148237@N21/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://mocpages.com/search_RESULTS.php?query=micropolis&#038;total=57&#038;page=1&#038;sort=best_match&#038;filter=moc&#038;personid=" target="_blank">MOCPages</a>, Facebook, <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/s/lego%20micropolis" target="_blank">Google+</a>, ad infinitum:), or something.



Anyway, the point really came home last weekend in Des Moines where we were <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cavort/8572015702/in/photostream" target="_blank">displaying our little corner of Micropolis again</a> and we also had the TwinLUG QR Code out on the table next to it. As usual we got several people who tried to use it, and mostly it worked (The lighting was a bit weird), but the overwhelming response to being sent to the TwinLUG site was one of disappointment. What people <em>really</em> wanted to see was lots of pictures and maybe some more stuff about what they were looking at right then. Obviously it was finally time to do something about it.



To get this really rolling though I was going to need to scale things back to just a place where we could put up information and pictures about just the modules that Jennifer and I own. Almost all of them are ones that we designed with the exceptions of some that I bought off a TwinLUG member before he moved out of the country a few years ago (Hi Gary!). Thanks to the wonderful photography skills of <a href="http://www.pointykitty.net/" target="_blank">Alyska Bailey-Peterson</a> we had a base of some excellent photos to go along with the drek that I manage to shoot so that we could at least get the site off the ground before having to figure out where we were going to get more good pictures.



For this project I think we really needed a Wiki. A blog or other groupware CMS system was just going to have too much overhead and complexity for the basic requirements of setting up easily linkable pages that could be simply protected from spam or other ne'er-do-wells with some file management capabilities. I finally settled on <a href="http://dokuwiki.org" target="_blank">DokuWiki</a> and I'm pretty happy with the results so far. My one small issue is that for some reason there are no simple methods of setting text alignment, but everything else is great so I'm ignoring that as much as possible. If you're looking for a good Wiki platform you should definitely add them to your list of candidates.



As of right now I've got pages up for eight modules and material for a couple more before we start to run out of images, but I think it's a decent start and hopefully we'll be able to keep some momentum on the project for awhile.



While right now the site is all about our collection and the layouts that we have been part of but I think we would be glad to broaden the content in the not too distant future. I do have things locked down so that even if you register for an account you can not make any edits until I tweak the account so please contact me if that is your intent.
