    After spending I have no idea how many millions of dollars to try and move cars and traffic <em>out</em> of downtown Minneapolis our illustrious, and sadly slightly flaky, Mayor has now decided that [maybe we need <em>more</em> traffic downtown](http://www.startribune.com/462/story/815949.html) but with fewer buses.
  
  
  
    I've got a better idea: How about we fully implement the original idea and see how that goes first!
