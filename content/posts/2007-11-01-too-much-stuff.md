    [<strong>Update:</strong> I appear to have lost the original post contents because of a really weird problem I'm having with my WordPress installation. I'm going to put in a very similar, though not identical post instead since I can't seem to find a cached version of the original.]
  
  
  
    I've been going through my attic lately and finding piles and piles of old computer stuff. I'm trying to decide if I want to get rid of it as one big lot of stuff, or part it out for whoever wants the various bits.
