One of the things that I like about the [Zune](http://www.zune.net) is that it has podcast support that is more like how I really use them rather than the way they work with iTunes. It's not perfect by any stretch (Why can't I squirt a podcast?) but it's generally very good. Good enough that I'm looking for more content to listen to.

I have two very different kinds of podcasts that I listen to for very different environments. I find that I can't listen to people talking without having to pay attention to them, at least if I want to get anything out of it. This is just as true of talk radio as it is of audio books. I also find that after 45 minutes of people yakking I get really, really bored pretty quickly but I find items less than 10min long to not be worth the effort to fiddle with the player to listen to (Not perfect #2: Can't put them in playlists). Which is really unfortunate since I otherwise would have a couple of really short items that I do like ([The Engines of Our Ingenuity](http://www.uh.edu/engines/) being a prime example).

So here's what I'm currently listening to:
<ul>
<li>
[BrassCast](http://brasscast.com/) (Brass band music)
</li>
<li>
[Savage LoveCast](http://podcasts.thestranger.com/savagelove/) (Dan Savage)
</li>
<li>
[Major Nelson](http://www.majornelson.com/) (Xbox gaming. I often end up fast forwarding through much of it)
</li>
<li>
[Dear Science](http://podcasts.thestranger.com/dear_science) (Science commentary. Deciding if I'm going to keep it.)
</li>
<li>
[Car Talk](http://cartalk.com/) (NPR show)
</li>
<li>
[This American Life](http://www.thislife.org/) (NPR show)
</li>
<li>
[Wait Wait Don't Tell Me](http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/) (NPR show)
</li>
<li>
[Windows Weekly](http://twit.tv/ww) (Tech news)
</li>
<li>
[Radio Lab](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/) (NPR show)
</li>
<li>
[They Might Be Giants](http://tmbg.com) (Oddities and live stuff from the band
</li>
<li>
[Counter Intelligence](http://www.startribune.com/counterintelligence/) (Star Tribune dining and food podcast)
</li>
</ul>
I also really used to love [SpaceMusic](http://www.spacemusic.nl/Podcast.html), but that shifted to a paid subscription model a year or so ago. Though looking on the site now there does appear to be some free stuff again so maybe I'll take a look at them again.

Any suggestions anyone?
