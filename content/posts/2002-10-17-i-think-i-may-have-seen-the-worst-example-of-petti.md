I think I may have seen the worst example of pettiness by someone that I actually know in recent memory. I am not going to link directly to it, but it did occur on the <a href="http://www.mnstf.org/mnstf">Mnstf</a> Natter discussion list.

I don't think that anyone has enjoyed the decline of Minicon, but I for one am not at all surprised with assholes like that around.

The real irony is that this example of superhuman idiocy happened in a discussion about cutting funding for a project because Mnstf doesn't have the cash flow it once did.
