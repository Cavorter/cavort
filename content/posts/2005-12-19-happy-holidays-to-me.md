I bought myself a digital camera for Christmas. I've been thinking about getting one for awhile and it worked out nicely with some other shopping I was doing.

The camera is a <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&#038;fcategoryid=145&#038;modelid=11125">Canon PowerShot A520</a>, and over the last day of playing with it seems to be pretty good. Not too small, not too large, decent optical zoom and while very simple to use also has lots of advanced stuff if I want to get into it.

Who knows, maybe I'll even eventually have to get a flickr account. (Okay, I doubt it too.)
