[They Might Be Giants](http://www.tmbg.com/indexa.html) are touring in support of their [new, very good, album "The Else"](http://theymightbegiants.com/index.html) and will be [in Minneapolis on September 19th at First Ave](http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/06003EF3B65691F1?artistid=736288&#038;majorcatid=10001&#038;minorcatid=60). (Which is a Monday and the TBA opening act starts at 9PM so likely to be a pretty late night)

Anyone want to go?
