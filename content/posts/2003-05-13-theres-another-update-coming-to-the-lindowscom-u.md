There's another update coming to the Lindows.com unsubscribe saga, but first this:

I actually used the word "practical" in the same sentence as "Religious Studies" and "Philosophy", and I was not under any outside influence, nor was I being sarcastic. What an odd experience.

The specific context was in reference to Huston Smith as follows:

> He's more into the practical aspects of religion so his background is in Religious Studies and Philosophy.

Speaking of <a href="http://www.tgrady.com/smith.htm">Huston Smith</a>, I have finally finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0062508113/qid=1052861985/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-0175686-7236656?v=glance&#038;s=books&#038;n=507846">The World's Religions</a> and can unequivocally state that it is the best material I have ever seen about various major religions. Really amazingly well put together, and I really like his approach and enthusiasm for the topic. Very highly recommended reading for just about anyone.
