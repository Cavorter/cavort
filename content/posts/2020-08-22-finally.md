It's been a long time in the making but I have finally transitioned this site to a static generated site being hosted on Azure. This past spring at Microsoft's Build conference they released a new product in preview called [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/) that HUGELY simplified setting this up. It's kind of funny because the previous weekend I had finally gotten back to starting to work on this transition and had gotten some build pipelines setup for all of the terraform for the infrastructure and now it turns out that absolutely none of that is needed anymore! I don't think of it as wasted time though since it's always a good idea to work through that kind of thing to keep your skills sharp.

At this point all of the old content _should_ be migrated however there are likely more than a few posts that will need some tweaking before they are completely accessible. If you find something please let me know via whatever contact info you have for me.

In the meantime, I'm not promising anything but I am hoping to be getting some more content up here eventually. I still owe Sigrid a write-up for the process I used for jail-breaking all of her Kindle books, just for example.
