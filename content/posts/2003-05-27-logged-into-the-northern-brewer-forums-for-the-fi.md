Logged into the [Northern Brewer Forum's](http://forum.northernbrewer.com/index.php) for the first time in too long and ran across a [Root Beer thread](http://forum.northernbrewer.com/viewtopic.php?t=5812&#038;highlight=)!&#xD;<br />&#xD;<br />Hopefully something comes of my replies to it.&#xD;<br />&#xD;<br />In the meantime, I haven't gotten around to the yeast test yet. Busy, and lack of motivation. Possibly mixed with some fear of more failure. Hopefully this weekend though.&#xD;<br />&#xD;<br />In the meantime, I did get [this link](http://hbd.org/brewery/library/RootB.html) out of that forum thread that is worth reading.&#xD;<br />&#xD;
