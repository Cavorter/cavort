Logged into the <a href="http://forum.northernbrewer.com/index.php">Northern Brewer Forum's</a> for the first time in too long and ran across a <a href="http://forum.northernbrewer.com/viewtopic.php?t=5812&#038;highlight=">Root Beer thread</a>!&#xD;<br />&#xD;<br />Hopefully something comes of my replies to it.&#xD;<br />&#xD;<br />In the meantime, I haven't gotten around to the yeast test yet. Busy, and lack of motivation. Possibly mixed with some fear of more failure. Hopefully this weekend though.&#xD;<br />&#xD;<br />In the meantime, I did get <a href="http://hbd.org/brewery/library/RootB.html">this link</a> out of that forum thread that is worth reading.&#xD;<br />&#xD;
