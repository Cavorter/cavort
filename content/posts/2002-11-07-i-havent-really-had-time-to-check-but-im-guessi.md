I haven't really had time to check, but I'm guessing that every blog in existence has some sort of political content right about now.

Here's mine:

The voter turn out in Minnesota was _huge_, especially for a non-presidential election year. The solid fact is that none of the candidates that I voted for made it into office but I _am_ reassured that the people who did make it to office did so by a large number of people who I disagree with voting for them.

Sure I'd love it if everybody agreed with me on who should have been elected, but then we wouldn't really need a democracy, now would we?
