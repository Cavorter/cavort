So we now have a choice: buy a complete season of Lost on high-quality DVD for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005JNOG/qid=1129158043/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-9926101-0787131?v=glance&#038;s=dvd&#038;n=507846">$38.99</a> from Amazon, or buy little tiny version from Apple that will play on your shiny new iPod Video for $34.99.

I'm probably going to buy an episode, just to see how it does look, but it's formatted to look nice on a 2.5inch screen. What is the likelihood it will be watchable on a computer monitor!
