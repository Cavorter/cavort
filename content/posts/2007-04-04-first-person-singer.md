    While a bit unfortunate that it is not longer, <a href="http://www.operaslinger.com">Opera Slinger</a> turns out to be unreasonably fun for such an odd premise: Using the classic WASD first person control scheme, get your character into the spotlight before the competition and then sing your heart out. It's only one level, and just four songs with some pretty corny lyrics so it plays out in less than 10 minutes. I did find navigating the opera house to be a bit more problematic than I would like, but I imagine running it a couple more times would solve lots of those issues.
