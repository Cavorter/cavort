    <a href="http://infodoodads.com/?p=13">Infodoodads pointed me</a> to another social book site that I think might fit my needs a bit better than <a href="http://www.cavort.org/2007/02/21/while-im-thinking-about-books/">the other three that I've played with</a> so far: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">goodreads</a>.
  
  
  
    My profile can be found <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29327">here</a> and I might play with the widget a bit and see what it looks like.
