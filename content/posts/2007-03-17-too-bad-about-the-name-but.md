[Infodoodads pointed me](http://infodoodads.com/?p=13) to another social book site that I think might fit my needs a bit better than [the other three that I've played with](http://www.cavort.org/2007/02/21/while-im-thinking-about-books/) so far: [goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/).

My profile can be found [here](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29327) and I might play with the widget a bit and see what it looks like.
