    So today we find out that WoW: Burning Crusade <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/collectors.html" target="_blank">will be a retail package and be available in regular and Expensive Collector's editions</a>.
  
  
  
    The thing that irritates me? They still don't have a release date other than <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/faq.html" target="_blank">"late 2006"</a>.
  
  
  
    (On a side note, I'm also a bit irritated that the last class to get information about the new spells and talents in the expansion are Hunters. They have to do them in some order and it may as well be this one.)
