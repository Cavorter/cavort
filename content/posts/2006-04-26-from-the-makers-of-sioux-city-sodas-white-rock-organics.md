While doing some quick soda shopping before a couple of friends stopped by to play some boardgames, I ran into some new bottles at the local [Kowalski's](http://www.kowalskis.com/) that looked interesting. [White Rock Organics](http://www.whiterockbeverages.com/Organics.cfm) soda comes in 3 flavors: Red Peach, Raspberry Creme, and Passion Orange. I got a 4 pack of all 3 flavors and have so far tasted very mixed results.

The Red Peach is actually incredibly good. It is more sweet and intensely flavored than I would normally like, but the carbonation is light enough and the cane sugar they are using is fairly decent quality so the flavor is at least very good. It also really tastes like very good fresh peaches.

The Raspberry Creme, on the other hand, tastes like cough syrup. And, as one of my friends last night pointed out, not even like <i>good</i> cough syrup. The flavor is fruity enough but the intense sweetness and the overwhelming sticky taste of bad vanilla-esque flavor is just horrible. None of us wanted to finish the bottle. I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of the other 3 bottles without offending someone I like, or just pouring them out. I'll probably give a second bottle a taste to see if it was just a bad bottle, but it tasted exactly like any other really badly fruit flavored soda I've ever had. Heck, it's easily in the same league as Shasta Strawberry, if you can believe that.

I still have yet to try the Passion Orange, though I'll probably get to that tonight. At this point I'm wondering if I should be looking forward to it with dread or excitement.
