    I finally got to see some of the [Hot Summer Jazz Festival](http://hotsummerjazz.com) last night. I arrived at Peavey Plaza just after [Frank Morgan](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&#038;sql=11:igke4j270waw) and [David Young](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&#038;sql=11:7l65mpeh9f5o) took the stage. What a totally excellent start to the evening for me. He and David, along with the rest of the combo played a great set while I wandered around looking for a place to sit. I even finally managed to find one by his second to last number and was able to finish my cheese curds in relative comfort, for sitting on a slab of cement 20 feet away from any smokers. :-)
  
  
  
    I did wander down between sets and got a good seat in an actual chair for [Barbara Morrison](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&#038;searchlink=BARBARA|MORRISON&#038;samples=1&#038;sql=11:7e8o1vf8zzca~T0) and was totally blown away by her. [Jon Weber](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&#038;sql=11:5n6htr6lkl5x) stayed up from Frank Morgan's set to play the piano, [Gordon Johnson](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&#038;sql=11:hjfpxql5ld6e) took over the bass and except for the light rain during her encore ("They call me Sundown") she showed us all why she's been a respected singer for as long as she has.
  
  
  
    I then went over to the Millenium where I caught the last few songs from the [Twin Cities Hot Club](http://twincitieshotclub.com/) set, and managed to get their CD after remembering to finally stop for cash on the way over. Then caught the first half of the next set with [Dennis Spears](http://www.dennisspears.com/) and company. At that point I hadn't been able to find a seat in the Millenium and after a full day of work decided it was best to head for the train and call it a night.
  
  
  
    There is still two days left though, and I plan to be there for a good chunk of it. I have some other plans for this evening but this afternoon and tomorrow afternoon have some great acts featured and I can't wait to hear them. Anyway, off to catch the train and buy an new umbrella at Target.
