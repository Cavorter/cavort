    I finally got to see some of the <a href="http://hotsummerjazz.com">Hot Summer Jazz Festival</a> last night. I arrived at Peavey Plaza just after <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&#038;sql=11:igke4j270waw">Frank Morgan</a> and <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&#038;sql=11:7l65mpeh9f5o">David Young</a> took the stage. What a totally excellent start to the evening for me. He and David, along with the rest of the combo played a great set while I wandered around looking for a place to sit. I even finally managed to find one by his second to last number and was able to finish my cheese curds in relative comfort, for sitting on a slab of cement 20 feet away from any smokers. :-)
  
  
  
    I did wander down between sets and got a good seat in an actual chair for <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&#038;searchlink=BARBARA|MORRISON&#038;samples=1&#038;sql=11:7e8o1vf8zzca~T0">Barbara Morrison</a> and was totally blown away by her. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&#038;sql=11:5n6htr6lkl5x">Jon Weber</a> stayed up from Frank Morgan's set to play the piano, <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&#038;sql=11:hjfpxql5ld6e">Gordon Johnson</a> took over the bass and except for the light rain during her encore ("They call me Sundown") she showed us all why she's been a respected singer for as long as she has.
  
  
  
    I then went over to the Millenium where I caught the last few songs from the <a href="http://twincitieshotclub.com/">Twin Cities Hot Club</a> set, and managed to get their CD after remembering to finally stop for cash on the way over. Then caught the first half of the next set with <a href="http://www.dennisspears.com/">Dennis Spears</a> and company. At that point I hadn't been able to find a seat in the Millenium and after a full day of work decided it was best to head for the train and call it a night.
  
  
  
    There is still two days left though, and I plan to be there for a good chunk of it. I have some other plans for this evening but this afternoon and tomorrow afternoon have some great acts featured and I can't wait to hear them. Anyway, off to catch the train and buy an new umbrella at Target.
