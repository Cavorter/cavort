I tried the White Rock Organics Passion Orange today at lunch and was really very pleasantly surprised. It's not as sweet as the very good Red Peach, which in turn is not as sweet as the horrible Raspberry Creme. I do have to admit that the initial flavor was sort of odd, but the finish and subsequent sips showed it to be a very well put together flavor. Some nicely sour passion fruit notes with the barest orange/citrus is an unexpectedly combination and the lack of over-the-top sugar makes for a really excellent soda.
