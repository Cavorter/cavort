I thought it was interesting that the mention of "Wits & Wagers" in [a recent Microsoft Xbox announcement](http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/03/17/arcadepricesdownandtocome.aspx) did not mention that it was a video game version of a fairly well lauded [board game](http://www.witsandwagers.com/games/wits_and_wagers/). Mostly I'm just looking forward to having another game to use my [Big Button controllers](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/s/sceneitlightscameraaction/) with.
