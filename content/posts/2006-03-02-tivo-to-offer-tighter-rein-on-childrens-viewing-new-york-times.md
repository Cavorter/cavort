Tivo's "Big Announcement" this morning is likely to be a yawner for those of us looking for something actually interesting technologically, but I'm guessing some parents might be happy:

The thing that I'm slightly aggravated about (besides the continued absense of an HD compatible Tivo, though that's at least some fault of CableLabs and their overly stringent policies) is that this feature could be implemented 2 ways, but they took the IMHO slightly more stupid route of making it kids only. The thing is that multi-user households have been asking for something very like this, but much simpler for AGES so that different people can have different sets of ratings and recordings on a Tivo. If they can do this, why can't that do that?
