**Recipe Number**: 1.0<br />
**Batch Number**: 1<br />
**Stage**: Carbonation<br />
**Elapsed Time**: 45 hours

Well, the first batch has to be somewhat disappointing. I opened up Bottle #1 and there was no carbonation what-so-ever. The color has continued to mellow towards amber and the floating sediment has arranged itself at 2 particular levels of the solution which might say something about the specific gravity of the solution at those points. Dunno though. The flavor was fairly good but not quite like a typical off the shelf root beer though there were very distinct similarities.

Anyway, it is possible that this is a result of a leaky bottle or bad/inactive yeast so I'm going to wait till tomorrow night and open the next one to give more time for some carbonation as well as let it mellow just a bit more. If that bottle is also completely flat I'll have to decide whether to open the rest of the batch or to give it another day.
