I'm running into some problems with comment posting on the 2 sites that I'm hosting on this box. I think it might have something to do with the configuration of MySql, which is used as the backend for both sites. If you see a "fatal error: : timeout" if you are trying to post a comment, I am aware of the issue and trying to figure it out. The comment will be posted, you'll just have to refresh.
