    <a href="http://amblypygid.livejournal.com" target="_blank">Amblypygid</a> and I made an entry for the <a href="http://reasonablyclever.com/lego/contest/dl06/index.html" target="_blank">Reasonably Clever DIRTY BRICK '06 contest</a> and finally <a href="http://www.reasonablyclever.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=78" target="_blank">submitted it</a> this past weekend. Over all I'm fairly happy with it. The dog head on the pommel really did come together very nicely and is probably what I am most proud of in the design.
