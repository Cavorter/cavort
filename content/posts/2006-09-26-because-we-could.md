    [Amblypygid](http://amblypygid.livejournal.com) and I made an entry for the [Reasonably Clever DIRTY BRICK '06 contest](http://reasonablyclever.com/lego/contest/dl06/index.html) and finally [submitted it](http://www.reasonablyclever.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=78) this past weekend. Over all I'm fairly happy with it. The dog head on the pommel really did come together very nicely and is probably what I am most proud of in the design.
