I just got out of seeing a preview screening of X3 and there are some positive things to say about it. All of the hair was really well done. The Stan Lee cameo was decent. It was better than Elektra. It might even be better than The Hulk.

Unfortunately that's about all the good things that I have to say about it. I could complain about the dialog that contained only cliches that I've heard too many times. Or I could complain about cinematography that used every shot that I've seen too many times. For a change of pace I could mention "acting" from several of the "actors" with speaking parts. If I really ran out of steam I could move on to the visual effects that have not seen their like since last week on SciFi's self produced movie of the week, whatever it was.

I think all that I really need to say is that there was not a single moment in this movie where I was surprised. There is not a single moment in this movie that really made me say, "Wow." There was not a single plot element that was not telegraphed so clearly, precisely, and early that the 6 month old sleeping in the back of the theater could follow along. There was not a single moment that made me feel pathos for any of the characters, good guys or bad. I got bored, and it was because this is not a movie that I could care about.

On the plus side, it was free.

<strong>Update</strong>: The friend I saw it with has <a href="http://resolute.livejournal.com/49137.html">a bit more to say</a>, though with plenty of spoilers.
