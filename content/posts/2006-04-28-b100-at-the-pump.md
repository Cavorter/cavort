> Good News! Biodiesel B100 will be offered at the pump tomorrow at the Pump-N-Munch on Lyndale and 63rd in South Minneapolis from 10-2 on Saturday April 29th.

More information about the group producing this can be had at <a href="http://www.tcbiodiesel.com">www.tcbiodiesel.com</a> and <a href="http://www.biodieselblue.com">www.biodieselblue.com</a>.

Unfortunately I couldn't wait for a fill up yesterday and since I hadn't heard any solid details I went ahead and did my first fill up at a Holiday in Bloomington.

I also went looking around and the <a href="http://www.vw.com/vwcom/content/objects/pdf/service_maint/BIODIESEL_ENG.pdf">official word from VW</a> is that using anything more than B5 might void my warranty. Given that my new vehicle still has just over 20k miles left on the powertrain warranty, I'm a bit wary of taking that step just yet.
