I've been using [Neeva](https://neeva.com) as my search engine for very happily for a couple of years now. It was probably one of the best changes I've made to my computing habits besides quitting Twitter. The results were good (early-on, only "good enough") included no ads, and it solicited feedback on the results so that over time the results got better. Much better. Plus it integrated into my own files, so I could do text searches for both the web and anything that I had written privately, all without trying to sell my data to anyone. Alas, on [June 2, 2023 they are shutting down their search engine](https://neeva.com/blog/may-announcement), just five days shy of exactly two years since I started using it. I need to find something else.

Here are the options that I've looked into so far and what I've found.

| Name | Index | Ads | Free | $$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Bing](#bing) | Proprietary | Yes | Yes | No |
| [Brave Search](#brave-search) | Proprietary | Yes | Yes | ? |
| [Ecosia](#ecosia) | ? | Yes | Yes | $0 |
| [DuckDuckGo](#duckduckgo) | ? | Yes | Yes | ? |
| [Kagi](#kagi) | Proprietary | No | Trial | $5-25/mo |
| [Qwant](#qwant) | Proprietery | Yes | Yes | No |
| [StartPage](#startpage) | Google | Yes | Yes | $0 |
| [YaCy](#YaCy) | Proprietery* | No | Yes* | Yes* |

## Bing
https://bing.com

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. No.

Seriously, I'm otherwise pretty deep in the Microsoft ecosystem (Though Windows 11 is on my last nerve ATM). The natural path would be for me to go to Bing. Their results are not as good as Google's. It isn't clear that their privacy and data policies are any better, and might be worse. Their suggested content is the absolute worst of the entire internet and I want to wash my eyeballs every time I get even a glance of it.

If Google is a "No", Bing is a "Hell No".

## Brave Search
https://search.brave.com

I know several people who use the Brave browser and are quite happy with it, and I've even recommended it to others, but I've never looked into their search engine. Apparently there is something called "Brave Search Premium" that might remove ads, but there is no public information about the specific features or the pricing without signing up for an account.

## DuckDuckGo
https://duckduckgo.com

## Ecosia
https://www.ecosia.org

## Kagi
https://kagi.com

The big feature here is sustainability and transparency. Yes, you will see ads, but they say they don't track your searches and use the profits to plant trees. Additionally, they claim to be generating enough of their own solar power that they are carbon negative. I also like that their cookie banner has a "Reject non-essential" as the first option next to "Accept all".

# A note on my methodology
I am not a hard core privacy or security person. I'm not going to talk about how many and what trackers or whatever. I do some rudimentary blocking of the obvious stuff and then let it go. More important for me is just seeing fewer ads. This is a fairly superficial list with some basic research and first impressions. For each candidate I tried the following searches which are relevant to me but with some spelling errors to help with the testing. I did create accounts where available. YMMV.
