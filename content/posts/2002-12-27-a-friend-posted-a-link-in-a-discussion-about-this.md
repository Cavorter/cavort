A friend posted [a link](http://hbd.org/brewery/cm3/recs/index.html#1500s) in a discussion about this topic to our BBS, [L-Space](http://www.cavort.org/l-space), and there are some interesting possibilities there. I do think that it does highlight exactly how little information is really available publicly about the topic though.

(A hit about navigation on that link: It's a sorted index of keywords and targets. If you scroll to the top of the page, you get links to the individual keywords, that take you to a listing of recipes that contain those keywords. Not precisely intuitive.)

Specifically, the [Cranberry-Ginger Soda](http://hbd.org/brewery/cm3/recs/12_40.html) I think is a good idea though I have some issues with the recipe. I would think that adding real fresh (or, more likely, frozen) cranberries to the wort would work much better than adding cranberry juice right before bottling. I'll have to give it a try at some point and see what happens.
