    After spending most of the day working on it, I think that I've got everything set up for a decent test on an <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> box here at home for hosting things. The good news is that comments work, but unfortunately things are pretty slow. This is almost certainly because the box I'm running things on is dreadfully slow and doesn't have much RAM. If things continue to work well I should have the good box up and running within a couple of days.
