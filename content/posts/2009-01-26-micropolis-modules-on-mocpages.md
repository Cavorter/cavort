I'm playing around with the recently massively upgraded <a href="http://mocpages.com">MOCPages site</a> and with the exception of the total lack of RSS or Atom support have found it relatively useful. This past weekend I re-photographed a number of my Micropolis modules and posted them. If you want to see more, take a look at:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://mocpages.com/moc.php/93601">Micropolis Construction Site</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://mocpages.com/moc.php/93595">Micropolis Water Tower (Rev 2)</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://mocpages.com/moc.php/93589">Micropolis Apatment Building (Rev 1)</a>
</li>
</ul>
At some point hopefully the feed support will come so I can just have new entries over there automatically picked up over here.
