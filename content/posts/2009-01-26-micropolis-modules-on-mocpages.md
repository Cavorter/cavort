I'm playing around with the recently massively upgraded [MOCPages site](http://mocpages.com) and with the exception of the total lack of RSS or Atom support have found it relatively useful. This past weekend I re-photographed a number of my Micropolis modules and posted them. If you want to see more, take a look at:
<ul>
<li>
[Micropolis Construction Site](http://mocpages.com/moc.php/93601)
</li>
<li>
[Micropolis Water Tower (Rev 2)](http://mocpages.com/moc.php/93595)
</li>
<li>
[Micropolis Apatment Building (Rev 1)](http://mocpages.com/moc.php/93589)
</li>
</ul>
At some point hopefully the feed support will come so I can just have new entries over there automatically picked up over here.
