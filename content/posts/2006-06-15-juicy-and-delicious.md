    I just had a real lychee fruit for the first time. I have had lychee flavored things, and various packaged lychee objects, but have never had the actual fruit. What an amazing little bundle of textures. The exterior of sharp bumps, the inner leathery skin, the meat of the fruit itself, the inner skin before the stone, and then the stone itself. A co-worker just offered one to me out of the blue and I'm really happy she did.
