Because I'm a big geek, I find the [results of the hardware survey performed by the Steam service](http://www.steampowered.com/status/survey.html) to be absolutely fascinating. <em>Seven</em> people who responded to the survey play games with 8 processors/cores. <em>93.96%</em> have DVD-ROM drives. I only wish that last statistic were true of the customers for the products that I work with. :-(
