    I looked at my blog for the first time in a very long time in Internet Explorer just a few minutes ago, and noticed that my sidebar isn't loading properly. Hopefully I'll take some time to fix it tonight, but if I don't get to it soon, just use <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox" target="_blank">FireFox</a> (like you already should be) and it displays with no problems.
