Just finished reading <a href="http://www.allensteele.com/">Allen Steele's</a> new novel "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spindrift-Allen-Steele/dp/0441014712/sr=8-1/qid=1162434030/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-8571437-2351237?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books">Spindrift</a>". It was really quite a good read but I could not shake the feeling that it was a book that I had read before. There just didn't seem to be much that was new or challenging in it, which in some ways I suppose can be a good thing but possibly just wasn't what I am looking for in a novel these days. The one exception would be the character of Ramirez who turns out to be slightly different than I expected and was fairly well developed as a plot hook. Still, a good read but I have trouble recommending it for purchase in hard cover unless you're already a fan of Allen Steele's work, or the Coyote series in particular.
