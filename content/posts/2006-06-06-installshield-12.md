[Macrovision](http://www.macrovision.com/) released [InstallShield 12](http://www.macrovision.com/products/flexnet_installshield/installshield/index.shtml) this morning, and my download of my maintenance fullfilment copy just finished. I've heard there were some big changes for the InstallScript language, hopefully for the better.

Update: I had heard slightly wrong, or at least read the commentary incorrectly. They changed the way that InstallScript custom actions interact with MSI packages. No big changes to InstallScript here!
