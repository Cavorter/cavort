Quick Update: Haven't done a damn thing since that last batch failed so badly. I've got some time off coming up though, so I'm going to look into doing a yeast test to figure out if there is a yeast out there that will work.



So far my plan is to try between 4-6 different yeasts in 2 bottles each with just water and sugar. I should get a good idea of what the individual flavors and carbonation levels are like from that. Any suggestions for yeasts to use would be <i>greatfully</i> accepted.
