I finally got around to looking at the new community features on Netflix this morning. There's some interesting stuff they're trying to do here that I can't help but think would work better with a more open model for social graphs. It was only a month or so ago that I found that a couple of friends had Netflix accounts and managed to get they added to my friend's list. More interoperability would make that sort of oversight very difficult, though there is the obvious (to me) caveat that these systems should also make it relatively easy to partition how some of that information travels.



Anyway, some items in particular with the Netflix Community features that I found interesting where the difference between "public" and "private" information and the "Reviewer Rank". I am, unsurprisingly, pretty low on the ranking coming in somewhere just shy of 65,000th.
