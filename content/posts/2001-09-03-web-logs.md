Web logs are one of those funny kinds of thing. They tend to have either very interesting stuff or tend to bore the pants off of people. Whatever my intent, I figure that this will probably end up being the later rather than the former.

Let's take care of a couple of things first:
Q. When will this be updated?
A. Dunno.

Q. Why are you doing this?
A. Dunno.

Q. Is there any particular reason I should check back later?
A. Dunno.

In the meantime, you can take a look at my favorite web comic (Goats)[http://www.goats.com]! There's a really very good storyline going on right now, and I'm happy to see some good things happening to some of those characters.

Later...
