    From [Singularity Sky](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441010725/ref=ase_charlieswebsi-20/104-5554065-7598302?s=books&v=glance&n=283155&tagActionCode=charlieswebsi-20) by [Charles Stross](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/):
  
  
  <blockquote>
    
      <em>I am the Eschaton. I am not your god.<br />I am descended from you, and I exist in your future.<br />Thou shalt not violate causality within my historic light cone. Or else.</em>
    
  </blockquote>
  
  
    The book immediately under that one (Not from a closet :-P )&nbsp;is [A Peace To End All Peace](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805068848/104-5554065-7598302?v=glance&n=283155) by [David Fromkin](http://www.bu.edu/ir/faculty/fromkin.html):
  
  
  <blockquote>
    
      By the end of the war, the export trade was down to a quarter and the import trade down to a tenth of what they had been.
    
    
    
      The Porte ran up huge budget deficits during the wartime years, and helplessly ran paper money off the printing presses to pay for them. During the war prices rose 1,675 percent.
