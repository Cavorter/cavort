I have a great idea!

Let's take a [hugely popular service](http://www.aim.com/) on the net, [produce an SDK for it](http://developer.aim.com) that finally lets external developers do things they have had to hack together for years, and then [put restrictions in place](http://developer.aim.com/license.jsp) that entirely cancel the most useful purpose for creating an "open" service in the first place!

Great job AOL! You've successfully proved, once again, that you <em><strong>still just don't get the net</strong></em>.
