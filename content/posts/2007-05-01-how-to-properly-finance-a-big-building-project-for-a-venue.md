Not that I have <em>any</em> hope of any of the assholes at any of the local major sports organizations to pay any attention to this, but you would think that it would be possible to use tidbits like [the Minnesota Orchestra privately financing a $90 million renovation for Orchestra Hall and Peavey Plaza in downtown Minneapolis](http://www.startribune.com/1646/story/1154272.html) to refute their continually idiotic requests for more public money for their monopolies. I personally get a whole lot more use out of that structure than I do out of any damned sports arena those fucking millionaires want me to help pay for, which is why I will probably be making a voluntary donation to this project at some point.
