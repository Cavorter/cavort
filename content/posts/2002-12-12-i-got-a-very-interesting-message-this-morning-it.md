I got a very interesting message this morning. It appears that [Black & White](http://www.gwgame.com) will be supporting the new [P5 virtual-reality glove](http://www.essentialreality.com/p5_glove.asp) from [Essential Reality](http://www.essentialreality.com/index.asp).

Basically, the P5 is the first commercially available glove that I've seen that is priced for the consumer. Honestly, I don't remember seeing anything much like this since the old [Nintento Power Glove](http://www.angelfire.com/ok2/stepinto/PowerGlovePage.html) for the original [Nintendo Entertainment System](http://www.rolandit.com/games/Systems/viewsys.asp?SID=4).

In any case, at US$150 I do wonder how good it is. As someone who owns both a first ([Logitech WingMan Force Feedback Mouse](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00001W01Z/104-5014425-5563132?vi=glance)) and second generation ([Logitech iFeel Mouseman]()) Force Feedback mice from [Logitech](http://www.logitech.com/), I do have to say that any new controller like this does get me thinking though.
