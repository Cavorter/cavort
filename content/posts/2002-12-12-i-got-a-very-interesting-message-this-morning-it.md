I got a very interesting message this morning. It appears that <a href="http://www.gwgame.com">Black & White</a> will be supporting the new <a href="http://www.essentialreality.com/p5_glove.asp">P5 virtual-reality glove</a> from <a href="http://www.essentialreality.com/index.asp">Essential Reality</a>.

Basically, the P5 is the first commercially available glove that I've seen that is priced for the consumer. Honestly, I don't remember seeing anything much like this since the old <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ok2/stepinto/PowerGlovePage.html">Nintento Power Glove</a> for the original <a href="http://www.rolandit.com/games/Systems/viewsys.asp?SID=4">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>.

In any case, at US$150 I do wonder how good it is. As someone who owns both a first (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00001W01Z/104-5014425-5563132?vi=glance">Logitech WingMan Force Feedback Mouse</a>) and second generation (<a href="">Logitech iFeel Mouseman</a>) Force Feedback mice from <a href="http://www.logitech.com/">Logitech</a>, I do have to say that any new controller like this does get me thinking though.
