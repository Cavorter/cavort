I've been running into a huge number of people who don't understand what's going on with HDTV lately, so I figured I needed to put something out for the couple of people who do read my blog.
<ol>
<li>
The HD broadcast switch <em>is</em> a funded federal mandate. (see item #3)
</li>
<li>
You do <strong>not</strong> have to get rid of your existing TV unless you really want to. (see item#3)
</li>
<li>
Every household in the US is entitled to two (2) coupons good for free HD to SD content converters. You can get your coupon from [https://www.dtv2009.gov/](https://www.dtv2009.gov/). These are set top boxes that go from a standard pair of rabbit ears or whatever you're using as an antenna to your TV and let you watch HD content on your regular old non-HD TV.
</li>
<li>
You are getting something (two things!) from the government for FREE here people.
</li>
<li>
If you plan to continue using a VCR or other SD equipment (Tivo series 1 and 2, Windows MCE, MythTV, etc) to record programming make sure that you get a converter box that can change channels on a schedule or can be controlled by your recording equipment. If your recording equipment has built in schedules of some kind they may not match the new HD lineup and schedule.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Shop for a new TV carefully.</strong> Just because you buy a new "HD capable" TV does not mean you can just hook up an antenna and start getting HD content. Many "HD Capable" TVs sold do not include an HD tuner (though it's better than it used to be) since for the most part the manufacturer's figure that you will have either a cable box or satellite receiver that will do the tuning instead. A TV with an HD tuner will likely cost $100-$200 more than an otherwise identical model.
</li>
<li>
Not all HD capable TVs are widescreen. Many manufacturers make several "normal" (4:3 aspect ratio) sets that are just as "HD capable" as their widescreen versions.
</li>
<li>
Not all HD capable TVs are light and thin. I personally own a ~125lb 30in widescreen CRT that I really quite like except when I decide to move it up or down stairs. CRTs still for the most part look better than other competing technologies. The problem is that, as evidenced by my 125lb wonder of modern technology, the technology does not scale well to really big screens.
</li>
<li>
"Plasma" TVs use much more power than a similarly sized CRT. Really big plasma TVs use proportionally more power. My brother heats his living room with his (Not a joke).
</li>
<li>
LCD TVs use much less power than a similarly sized CRT. Really big LCD TVs use proportionally more power which may actually be more than your current 27in non-HD TV uses. Do not take the word of the salesman at the store on this one, get a [Kill-A-Watt](http://www.p3international.com/products/special/P4400/P4400-CE.html) and find out for yourself.
</li>
<li>
The biggest downside to many of the non-CRT technologies is that they can be very difficult to see anything when you are not directly in front of them (though it is much better than it was a few years ago). Some sets are much better than others. If the comfy chair is off in a corner you may not be able to watch anything on that big new thing heating the living room. Before you go to the store, figure out where you might end up trying to watch it from in your room and figure out what that distance and angle are and try and replicate it in the store to see what it will look like.
</li>
<li>
A 30in widescreen TV has a picture that is about the same size vertically as a 27in "normal" (4:3) TV. Remember that the measurement is diagonal.
</li>
<li>
You do not have to have cable or satellite to get local broadcast HD channels. Most satellite receivers get their local HD content from an antenna you hook up to the back of them. Some cable systems don't display all of the local HD channels.
</li>
<li>
Most cable systems highly compress their content so it is very possible that NBC/ABC/CBS/FOX/PBS/CW/etc might look better from an antenna in your area.
</li>
<li>
Not all content from HD sources is really HD. There's quite a bit of programming (especially children's and daytime programming) that is still displayed in SD. Re-runs of Cheers and Friends will always be in SD. The HD source might make it look a bit better than the old SD signal though.
</li>
<li>
Not all stations that are broadcasting in HD are broadcasting HD content at all. Up until Fall of 2007 [my local CW affiliate](http://www.thecwtc.com/) in particular was broadcasting everything in 480P which meant the widescreen dramas (Like Smallville) get shrunk to fit the lower resolution and looked really bad on my widescreen set with black bars on all sides. (Thanks to Aaron for pointing out they had changed over) Still, it is something to watch for in your area, especially on stations that are not affiliated with the big four networks.
</li>
</ol>
That's all that I can think of right now but if anyone has any questions feel free to ask them. If I don't know the answer I'm more than willing to look them up.
