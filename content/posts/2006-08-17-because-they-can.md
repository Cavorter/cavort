    Google has a booth at the big Star Trek convention in Las Vegas this weekend. I found out from <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/stardate-081706.html" target="_blank">this somewhat entertaining post</a> on the official Google blog. It's just sort of funny to think of a corporation the size of Google going out of their way to point out how high their geek quotient is.
