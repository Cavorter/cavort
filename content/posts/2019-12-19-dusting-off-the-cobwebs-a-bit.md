Over the past couple of years since I last added a new post to this blog I've been halfheartedly working on converting from WordPress to one of the modern static generators but luckily a recent involuntary, but somewhat welcome, change in employment has freed me up to finally (hopefully) make some progress on that front. With any luck I'll have the site updated to new hosting and back-end by the end of the year. I'll be trying to document that process at least in the [code repos](https://github.com/Cavorter/static-site-on-az-tf), and possibly with a few posts here as well.

Update: It looks like I'll be able to do one of the important settings in Terraform finally [very soon](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/pull/5143).
