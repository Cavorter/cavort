Microsoft launched the <a href="http://im.live.com">I'm Initiative</a> yesterday and I had trouble finding information about it this morning so I figured I would put up a link here to hopefully make it a bit easier for the next person. <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> had slightly more relevant results than Microsoft's own <a href="http://search.live.com">Live Search</a>, which is actually beginning to be disturbingly common. It's a <em>really</em> bad sign when Google is better at searching MSDN than anything that Microsoft offers.

Since I use MSN for IM at work, it's a fairly simple thing to do that does a little bit though I have no illusions about the probable $0.005 per year difference it's making.
