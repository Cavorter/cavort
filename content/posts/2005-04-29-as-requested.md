The results of a stupid online test:

<span style="font-size:180%;"><b>Your brain: 40% interpersonal, 140% visual, 100% verbal, and 120% mathematical!</b></span>
Congratulations on being 400% smart! Actually, on my test, everyone is. The above score breaks down <span style="color:blue;"><b>what kind of thinking you most enjoy</b></span><br />doing. A score above 100% means you use that kind of thinking more than<br />average, and a score below 100% means you use it less. It says nothing<br />about how good you are at any one, just how <i>interested</i> you are in each, relatively. A substantial difference in scores between two people means, conclusively, that they are <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">different kinds</span> of thinkers.

<b>Matching Summary:</b> Each of us has different tastes. Still, I offer the following advice, which I think is obvious:

<ol>
<li>
Don't date someone if your <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 102);">interpersonal percentages</span> differ by more than <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 102);">80%</span>.
</li>
<li>
Don't be friends with someone if your <span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">verbal percentages</span> differ by more than <span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">100%</span>.
</li>
<li>
Don't have sex with someone if their <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">math percentage</span> is over <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">200%</span>.
</li>
</ol>
