Speaking of too many hobbies, I've actually done some work with one of them that you can even see!

Last night I finished the first version of a simple web app for us here at the Cavort household to be able to post images to the web really easily. It doesn't do much, but it works, and that's really the important part.

You should be able to see it at http://www.cavort.org/Images.

The current plan is to add thumbnails, custom titles, and descriptions to the folder lists as well as navigation and comments to each of the images.

If anyone knows of a good ActiveX control to generate thumbnails server side, I would be glad to hear about it. I'm guessing that there is something in the .Net CLR (or someone's published assembly somewhere) that would let me do the same thing, but I'm not quite ready to move to .Net just yet.
