    About the same time that I implement OpenID on my personal blog for authentication and finally get a personal OpenID running so I can use it elsewhere, I start hearing it talked about all over the place. Nice to see that it might be a technology that gets adopted broadly.
  
  
  
    The OpenID I plan on using publicly is http://cavorter.cavort.org, so if you see some permutation of that around the net where OpenID is allowed, it should be me.
  
  
  
    Likewise, the OpenID stuff here appears to be _mostly_ working pretty well. The small issue that I'm having right now is trying to tweak my comment spam detection package (<a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/">Spam Karma 2</a>, Highly recommended) to stop dropping OpenID validated comments in the spam bucket because the Name listed is a URL. I think I've mostly got it figured out though finally.
  
  
  
    Also, those of you who actually visit the site have probably noticed that I did actually get around to switching templates. I have tried to use Ocadia before but never thought it quite worked. The new widget-ized version is pretty good, but I need to tweak the sidebar some to get it to a more functional width. Unfortunately I'm pretty sure that means I'm going to need to fiddle with the graphics. Oh joy.
