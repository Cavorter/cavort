<strong>I Am A:</strong> Chaotic Good Human Sorcerer (4th Level)<br /> <u>Ability Scores:</u><br /> <strong>Strength-</strong>11<br /> <strong>Dexterity-</strong>11<br /> <strong>Constitution-</strong>12<br /> <strong>Intelligence-</strong>15<br /> <strong>Wisdom-</strong>12<br /> <strong>Charisma-</strong>13

<u>Alignment:</u><br /> <strong>Chaotic Good</strong> A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but he's kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society. Chaotic good is the best alignment you can be because it combines a good heart with a free spirit. However, chaotic good can be a dangerous alignment because it disrupts the order of society and punishes those who do well for themselves.

<u>Race:</u><br /> <strong>Humans</strong> are the most adaptable of the common races. Short generations and a penchant for migration and conquest have made them physically diverse as well. Humans are often unorthodox in their dress, sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful clothes, tattoos, and the like.

<u>Class:</u><br /> <strong>Sorcerers</strong> are arcane spellcasters who manipulate magic energy with imagination and talent rather than studious discipline. They have no books, no mentors, no theories just raw power that they direct at will. Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire them more slowly, but they can cast individual spells more often and have no need to prepare their incantations ahead of time. Also unlike wizards, sorcerers cannot specialize in a school of magic. Since sorcerers gain their powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through, they have more time to learn fighting skills and are proficient with simple weapons. Charisma is very important for sorcerers; the higher their value in this ability, the higher the spell level they can cast.
