I know what I will be doing on the afternoon of March 3rd: <a href="http://www.mplib.org/eastlake.asp?0207">East Lake Library Grand Opening</a>



I am really happy that the building is finally completed and am looking forward to using the facility. What I am not looking forward to as much is how the current financial troubles in the Minneapolis Public Library system are going to effect how and when I can use that facility.
