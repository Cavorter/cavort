    Yesterday in a fit of total idiocy I managed to fry my skin pretty badly, though there is actually quite a bit of success to this little story. I always _used_ to fry my head really badly in the sun on weekends like this. But now I've finally gotten into the habit of reliably wearing a good hat so my head, face, and even my neck are just fine. Slightly overexposed, but really just very slightly.
  
  
  
    Unfortunately in my new found confidence I completely flaked on using sunscreen on any of the rest of my exposed skin and so now my knees are throbbing, or at least they are when the aloe gel stuff dries out and I haven't put any more on just yet. And in a bid to look like a total idiot, I've decided to try something interesting: Last night I was having horrible trouble with the gel drying out on my skin so I kept on having to re-apply gel something like every 20-45min. This morning I took a nicely temperature controlled shower to get the sticky remains from last night off and then applied gel afterwards and wrapped it in food grade plastic wrap. I have absolutely no idea if this is a really good idea or not, but I've gone nearly a hour without having to re-apply and things are still nicely cooled underneath the wrappings.
  
  
  
    Of course, I look like a total: well, headcase I suppose. With forearms and knees encased in clear plastic wrap with somewhat vivid green goo underneath I'm thinking I'm going to skip out on much in the way of public appearances today.
  
  
  
    BTW - Just in case any of you were wondering, I was in fact macho enough to try to get pants on and attempt to go to work. It was merely excrusiatingly painful until I tried to walk some stairs and then it became somewhat of a whimper and scream sort of experience. I think calling in sick to work, even if explaining to your boss that it's because of a sunburn of all things, was probably a very wise decision.
