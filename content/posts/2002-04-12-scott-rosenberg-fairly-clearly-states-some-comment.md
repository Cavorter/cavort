Scott Rosenberg fairly clearly states some comments that I'm hearing echo'd all around the industry these days in his [recent column on Salon](http://www.salon.com/tech/col/rose/2002/04/12/microsoft_man_months/index.html). I don't necessarily agree with his final conclusions, but I don't think that anyone really has any illusions about how successful Microsoft is going to be with their new official push for better security, or, in MS SpinSpeak, "Trustworthy Computing".

Whatever.
