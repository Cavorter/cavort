    I'm playing with a new music social network web toy right now called <a href="http://www.qloud.com" target="_blank">Qloud</a>. It's very similar to <a href="http://www.lastfm.com" target="_blank">Last.fm</a> which I have been playing with for a couple of years now, but in some ways the service might have a better outlook.
  
  
  
    So far the service is pretty rough. Searching from the main page can be painful. The interface is: difficult. The iTunes plug-in needs some very serious work (Advice: Whatever you do, try not to accidentally put a '\' in any of your tags. I can't use the plug-in at work anymore because I've got a tag with that in it and it crashes iTunes withing seconds of launching and there does not appear to be any way to remove tags outside the plug-in.). The track information database they have is problematic with some tracks having entirely wrong attributions, many albums not existing at all, no way to input new information, and horrible handling of non-english character sets.
  
  
  
    But it's interesting and different, and has some potential.
  
  
  
    If you do decide to take a spin with it, sign up using <a href="http://www.qloud.com/register/cavorter" target="_blank">this link</a>&nbsp;and I get points for the referral.
