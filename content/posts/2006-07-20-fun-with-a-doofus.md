    The newest game on XBox Live Arcade is a hoot of a platform puzzler called [Cloning Clyde](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/c/cloningclydelivearcadexbox360/default.htm). The humor can sometimes be somewhat low brow, but the creativity of the puzzles and the incredibly fun environments and puzzles made me loose track of 2 hours last night and register it essentially instantly. I can't wait to try it in multi-player.
