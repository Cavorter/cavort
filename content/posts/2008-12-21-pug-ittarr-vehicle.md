I saw a post on The Brothers Brick the other day with [a new vehicle meme](http://www.brothers-brick.com/2008/12/14/racing-on-treads/) that looked pretty interesting and today I finally got the chance to sit down and build something and came up with "Pug".

The cockpit for Pug is where my design diverges from the meme spec which calls for it to be sealed. I've been looking for a good way to use the [angled trans-blue window parts](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=2468) from an [airport set](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?S=10159-1) that J and I won a few years ago in a contest and finally figured out a good use for it. It took me quite awhile to figure out the SNOT techniques required to get it mounted properly, and honestly the parts are not as secure as I would normally like them to be in a MOC, but I think it looks damned good.

I'm also quite pleased at the track design. I've been playing around with interesting intersecting angles with Technic lift arms and was able to put it to very good use. The combination of angles on both the exterior and interior parts lends both stability and some neat lines to an otherwise somewhat boxy look. Having the third wheel mounted lower also makes for a cool raked angle for the vehicle as whole.

All in all it's not perfect but was quite satisfying given that I was working with J's enormous bin of parts rather than my own neatly organized collection.
