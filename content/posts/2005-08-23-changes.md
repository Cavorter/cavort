    As you may have noticed, I have changed blogging tools from Blogger to WordPress. Blogger appears to be stuck with the same old fairly decent, yet not very shiny, features and I wanted something new to play with.
  
  
  
    You will probably notice that both of the old blogs have been combined and the import of the old content worked almost as well as I wanted it to. I'll be checking to see what I missed and adding it as I get more time.
  
  
  
    L-Space is still running strong. Go poke you collective noses in if you have a minute. New blood is always nice.
