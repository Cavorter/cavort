I finally bought an XBox 360 yesterday. The Target up the street had a whole pile of the Premium systems actually in stock when I popped in. I do feel better that I did agonize over the decision a bit, and I only bought one game (that was on sale) but I'm still feeling slightly dirty about it.

Also, ripping DVDs to an easily useful format to play back over the Media Center Extender is a royal pain in the ass. I should note that I am only working on this for the DVDs that I own and have no designs or intentions to expand that to any that I don't own.

I did notice one odd thing: It doesn't appear to be able to find the MP3 files that I have legally ripped from my collection of legal CDs when I'm browsing through the MCE or Media Connect interfaces. Not sure why that is yet, but I'm sure I'll find a simple answer pretty quickly.

Anyway, if anyone is interesting in adding me to their Friends list,
