    From Terry Pratchett:
  
  
  <blockquote>
    
      Let grammar, spelling and punctuation enter your life. Yes, publishers have people who will do this sort of thingâ€”and they are called authors.
    
  </blockquote>
  
  
    (I haven't been able to run down a link to the quote, and I only have it from an <a href="http://harpercollins.com/members/authortracker/index.aspx">AuthorTracker</a> message.)
