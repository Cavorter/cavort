    TivoToGo has arrived! A bit late, and a not without some bitterness, but it's finally here right now and I am currently copying a couple of things off just to see how it goes.
  
  
  
    I've been hearing a lot on the net from people who already had gotten the update that they're really disappointed about the transfer speed, but I can't really say that I'm surprised. Even if you are using 802.11b, and not something sensible like 100mb ethernet, the biggest bottleneck here is NOT the network connection, but the USB 1.1 port that the network connection is attached to. Transmit speeds will not increase until they do something about that, and that's not likely to be another service update.
