I think I spent about 10 hours listening to live music yesterday. It might have been 11, but it's hard to remember precisely at this point. There is one particular good, and one particular not-so-good observation I have from yesterday however.

Good: SPF30 sunscreen, applied early enough, does actually keep me from roasting my skin and repeating last year's idiocy of getting a burn on my knees bad enough to make walking painful.

Not-so-good: The last run on the LRT from the Nicollet Mall station leaves at 1:18am. I had thought I had seen that the last train was at around 2:30, but it turns out that is the last train heading into town, not out. However cabs seem to be quite plentiful at even that time and are not actually hideously expensive when there is a good driver who doesn't try any shenanigans and takes you exactly the route you would have told them.

After <a href="http://www.cavort.org/2007/06/30/swing-the-night-away/">the great time I had on Friday</a>, I was excited to get back downtown and I arrived in time to see the <a href="http://www.isd196.k12.mn.us/avhs/dept/perf_arts/band/">Apple Valley High School Jazz Ensemble 1</a> who seemed to be a pretty decent high school big band, but was not quite what I was looking for at that point in the day so as soon as I heard the main stage start up I headed down there and was quite glad that I did. <a href="http://www.hotsummerjazz.com/artists.html">Bill Crutcher and Work In Progress</a> had started their set and played a great mix of stuff. I have to say that I have a weakness for good vibraphone playing and despite the only good seating available at this time being the acres of baking concrete in the hot early afternoon sun it was great to hear someone of his caliber playing. The rest of the band was also very good and it's too bad they didn't have a slightly better position on the schedule.

I stuck around for the MITY performance and was fairly impressed with a fair amount of it. In particular one of their pianists sounds like he might have a promising future, and already has a distinctive image with a wild mane of long curly hair. I popped back to the Dakota Foundation stage for the last half of the <a href="http://www.krossum.com">Kelly Rossum Quartet</a> who is always good. I had managed to remember to get cash, so I got two of his CDs for a bargain price as well.

Then it was dinner at <a href="http://www.masa-restaurant.com">Masa</a> on the street. I had the Puerco Veracruzana and a Mayan Margarita. The salsas served with the chips are exceptional, and the pork was very good, but the Mayan Margarita was very slightly disappointing in that I had been hoping for something a bit more understated and delicate than the seize-my-mouth-with-both-hands experience that I got. Toned down a bit I think it would be a great drink but as it stands it's just too much. Or maybe I'm just pining for the only really truly amazing margarita I've ever had, at Chapultepec in Chicago a couple of years ago. Next time I'll try the Sangria Blanca instead since that was the other option I had been thinking off. (While I'm talking about Masa, it is both great and a little strange to see a restaurant of that caliber with a <a href="http://www.masa-restaurant.com/Masa_to_go.pdf">To-Go menu</a> on their website. Yet another reason to miss working downtown.)

Finished dinner in perfect time to get a good seat for <a href="http://www.hotsummerjazz.com/artists.html">Paul Stubblefield</a>, who I felt kind of bad for. He's obviously a pretty good entertainer, but the crowd just didn't seem to be working for him. Though maybe my use of the word "Entertainer" is kind of telling since he did come across as a classic Las Vegas lounge act. That does have it's place, but maybe not at a Jazz Festival at prime time. He did have a split set with 19 year old sax phenom <a href="http://www.alexhan.com/">Alex Han</a> and I can't help thinking that I'm not the only one who might have rather seen a full set from Alex in the first place. He's intensity and improvisation skill had some of the crowd on their feet a couple of times and with Taylor Tanner, Gordy Johnson, and Kevin Washington playing rhythm they were a shoe-in for an encore that was fantastic.

After that it was a fairly quick setup for Charmaine Neville to come out and top it all off the right way. I had not known she could do that sort of Louis Armstrong impersonation, and she used it to pretty good effect. Not quite enough to make it a gimmick but enough to show what sort of range she's got. Her band was absolutely stellar too, and I'm really glad that she has them warm up the crowd with a song before she gets on stage.

After that it was a quick walk up to the Dakota where I caught the end of Willie West and the festival jam session over an order of the really tasty french fries, which the Dakota serves with an excellent Bearnaise sauce. It was pretty obvious that people were thinking along the same lines I had been when the last combo on the stage included both Grace Kelly and Alex Han. After trading solos with the rest of the band for the first 20min, Kevin Washington finally goaded them into doing an improvisation duet that was exactly the kind of music I had been hoping to hear staying up for the jam. Trading licks like they did was a great end to the evening and the right note to go home on.

My armchair observation: Grace Kelly needs the polish that Alex Han has developed over the 5 years that he's been playing to be a great musician, but Alex needs to work on the stage presence that Grace has already gotten to be a great entertainer. I'm fairly certain that All Grace needs is time to develop the polish, but I wonder if Alex will ever look really comfortable speaking to the crowd on stage.

Off to day 3, which should be full of really great latin jazz on the main stage.
