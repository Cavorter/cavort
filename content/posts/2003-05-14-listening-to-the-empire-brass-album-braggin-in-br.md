Listening to the [Empire Brass](http://www.empirebrass.com/) album [Braggin' In Brass](http://www.empirebrass.com/cd-html/braggin.html) it's really obvious what the difference between technically well executed jazz, and really good jazz is. Unfortunately, this is only an example of technically well executed jazz. It's good to listen to, but it just sounds so clean and sterile. Good jazz to me is anything but sterile, and work by similar instrumentation such as [Big Mama Digdown's](http://mamadigdown.com/) is <u><i><b>Great</b></i></u> jazz. There is so much substance and spirit behind the performance that it makes such a huge difference in the overall quality.
