    I had a lovely evening tonight taking in a couple of [Fringe Festival](http://www.fringefestival.org) shows. Even though I got out of work a bit later than I had expected, the schedule worked well to do a Light Rail Line-Up by first heading up to the [Mill City Museum](http://www.millcitymuseum.org/) for ["The Rat's in the Walls"](http://www.fringefestival.org/showDetail.cfm?showID=540), a one man H.P. Lovecraft tale done in wonderful style and good atmosphere. My only quibble is that I was a bit disappointed in the large film screen that was unused on the wall that really dominated the stage visually. Given the content of the show the rock wall the screen was on would have added so much more atmosphere without the screen. Given that it looked like a permenant feature, it's not something the cast or crew could have done anything about.
  
  
  
    Next stop was at the [Mixed Blood Theater](http://www.mixedblood.com/) for [Illinois Jane and the Pyramid of Peril](http://www.fringefestival.org/showDetail.cfm?showID=310), a fun farce with faux French and fancy footwork for the far out fight scene. Seriously: the coreography of the big fight was really well done for such a simple show. Though some of the jokes did run a bit long, overall a nice light show to end the evening.
