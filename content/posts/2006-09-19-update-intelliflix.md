    Just an update about how Intelliflix is doing. I decided back in July that it wasn't worth the hassle of trying to cancel my prepaid 1 year membership, so I'm just keeping track of how it's performing at this point.
  
  
  
    A couple of interesting tidbits:
  
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      The inventory of Xbox 360 titles displayed on their site has not changed since I joined on April 8, 2006, even though 24 titles have been released since then.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have received exactly 2 game discs from Intelliflix, both of them Xbox games. (I joined because they advertised that they rented Xbox 360 games.)
    </li>
    <li>
      I have received a total of 25 discs from Intelliflix in the time that I have received 69 discs from Netflix.
    </li>
    <li>
      It takes an average of 6 days for a movie to report as "shipped" before I see it in my mailbox. (Fastest: 3 days. Longest: 10)
    </li>
    <li>
      It takes an average of 4 days for a movie to be reported as "returned" after I ship it back. (Fastest: 3 days. Longest: 5 days)
    </li>
    <li>
      Longest time between shipments in a queue: 52 days. (At the suggestion of their customer support department, I have my account split into 3 queues. The "game" queue has shipped 2 discs to me in the time that it has existed, I have received one of those. The queue was created on July 5, 2006.)
    </li>
    <li>
      The most notable feature added to their website is that now they tell you which of the items in your queue they apparently do not have in their inventory.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  
    As you can see I'm still not particularly happy with the service, but I think it would be far more trouble to cancel my 1 year prepaid membership than to continue to track how well they are doing and maybe satisfy my curiosity about whether they actually have any Xbox 360 games at all or not.
