    I just don't know if I can even begin to be properly pessimistic about the chance that the [newly announced series of Avengers movies](http://blog.newsarama.com/2006/08/11/marvel-studios-overview-avengers-avengers-and-avengers/) is going to be even watchable. Have you seen the travesty that is [The Ultimate Avengers Movie](http://imdb.com/title/tt0491703/maindetails)? It's not even like the recent Marvel movies have been really very good. The decline in quality is obvious, and by the time they get around to this long list it will be [Captain](http://imdb.com/title/tt0078937/) [America](http://imdb.com/title/tt0103923/) all over again.
