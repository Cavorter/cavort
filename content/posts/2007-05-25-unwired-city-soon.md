According to [this document](http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/wirelessminneapolis/WirelessMapTimeline_Jan07.pdf) I should be able to use the [city of Minneapolis' new wifi network](http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/wirelessminneapolis/) by the end of the summer. It will be very interesting to see how it competes with my current DSL connection from Qwest.
