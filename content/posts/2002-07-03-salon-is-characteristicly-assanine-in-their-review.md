Salon is characteristicly assanine in their review of <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2002/07/03/mibii/index.html">Men in Black II</a>. Not that I'm particularly expecting it to a be a particularly good movie, I just thought that maybe the reviewer should work more than 30 seconds on coming up with the inane drivel that was completely incoherent until the second page.
