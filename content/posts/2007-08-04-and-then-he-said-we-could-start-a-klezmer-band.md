While we didn't get to any actual gaming this last session, <a href="http://kalikanzeros.livejournal.com">Shaun</a> mentioned that he had acquired a clarinet and was was re-learning to play it after <a href="http://kalikanzeros.livejournal.com/577085.html">having a sort of relevatory moment at the Winnipeg Folk Festival</a>. So I mentioned that I had acquired a euphonium a few years ago but had been horrible about actually getting it out and playing it very often (though I am proud to say it comes out at least once every six months, which is better than nothing) and <a href="http://laffingbuddha.livejournal.com/">Mark</a> mentioned that he hadn't played his trumpet in quite awhile.

So we can blame him when he also said something like, "We could start a klezmer band:" and <a href="http://kalikanzeros.livejournal.com/583840.html">so we are</a>. I ordered a copy of <a href="http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/store/smp_detail.html?item=5033802&#038;cart=33950786961990887">"Easy Klezmer Music"</a> while we were talking.

I've had a couple of chances to play my horn since then and I'm both stunned at how much I've forgotten and also at how easily some of it is coming back. It's really nice to have that old brass smell around the house.
