Found a <a href="http://www.brewbeer.cc/index.php?ProductID=23&#038;Detail=1">good link</a>, with recipes and tips, from a brew supply store in Corvllis, OR USA called Corvallis Brewing Supply. He also highly recommends starting with 2 liter bottles and extracts. Well, I do tend to do things the hard way.
