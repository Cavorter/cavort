I'm pretty sure that any service/interface that features the ability to selectively share content with only those you wish has a pretty big flaw when displaying something like this:

{{< figure src="http://www.cavort.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/lj-irritant.jpg" title="Instant paranoia generator: Just add emotion" caption="Instant paranoia generator: Just add emotion" >}}

I am pretty certain that this is just a blip on LJ's system that accidentally let it through but I am not precisely in the best state to take it wholly as harmless.

In any case, why would you have a system designed for some privacy built to even allow something like this?
