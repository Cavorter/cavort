    [Joystiq is reporting](http://feeds.joystiq.com/weblogsinc/joystiq?m=167) that Kings Quest III has been [updated and re-released](http://www.infamous-adventures.com/index.php?page=kq3). I came to the King's Quest games remarkably late in the series so I'm looking forward to playing through this.
