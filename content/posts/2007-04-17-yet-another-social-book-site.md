Not that the books themselves are social, though I can think of a few fictional libraries where that might be true, but [Revish](http://www.revish.com/) is yet another social website with a focus on books. In some ways it's closer to what I've been looking for than the other ones I've [seen](http://www.cavort.org/2007/03/17/too-bad-about-the-name-but/) http://www.cavort.org/2007/02/21/while-im-thinking-about-books/. In any case, I have a [profile there too now](http://www.revish.com/people/Cavorter/).
