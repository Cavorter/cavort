I finally saw [AI](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0212720) last night. I have recently decided to give [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com) a try, and figured this would be the best way to see a few movies I just haven't gotten around to. Sure enough, I had it 2 weeks before I got around to watching it, but I think it was worth the wait.

Overall, I did enjoy the movie though I think that I have to agree with just about everyone else that I've heard espouse an opinion about it in that I think the last 15 minutes could be just left off and it would be a far better movie. The featurette that was on the DVD kept on insisting that Spielberg didn't really do much to the script, except change everything, and I do have to wonder if that entire sequence wasn't his work.

But it was good. Overall, very good.
