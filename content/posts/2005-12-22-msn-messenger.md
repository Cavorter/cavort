The company I work for has recently been very pushy about insisting that people use MSN Messenger as the only "approved" IM service. I had been proxying through IMSmarter, until they went belly up last week.

So this week I am using MSN Messenger v7.5, and finding it to be: adequate. But a coworker was able to figure out how to solve my biggest irritation: That damned tab bar on the left side! By default you can't do a thing to modify it, and it's just in the way and slowing things down. But she figured it out:

> go to tools -> options -> security -> then select 'this is a shared pc don't display my tabs"

And thus, the thrice damned tabs from hell are banished!
