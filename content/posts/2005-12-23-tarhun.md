A friend at work gave me a bottle of Tarhun for Christmas! It's Russian tarragon soda, so completely unlike anything made domestically. It's also quite tasty, though possibly an acquired taste.

The company that produces it also produces <a href="http://www.ost-group.com/?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=85&#038;Itemid=38">quite a few other sodas</a>, several of which I have tried and they are all fairly uniformly interesting and good. (Tarhun is the third in that list)
