I'm not going to say much about "A Dirty Job" by Christopher Moore. People who like Christopher Moore will like "A Dirty Job". People who don't like Christopher Moore will not. If you don't know if you like Christopher Moore be warned that Mr Moore takes his whimsy very seriously and as long as you can keep up with his introduction of impossibility you should do just fine. While not nearly as surreal as Robert Rankin they inhabit nearby universes, neither of which is your own.
