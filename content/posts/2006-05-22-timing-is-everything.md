I was at Valleyfair yesterday but left not too long before <a href="http://www.startribune.com/462/story/446161.html">a bit of excitement</a>. Am I the only one that thinks the safety report is a bit lurid and overblown? 1 error in 10 years of operation sounds reasonable.

Also, I did get to ride on the new ride called <a href="http://www.valleyfair.com/public/attractions/rides/thrill_rides/xtreme_swing.cfm">"Xtreme Swing"</a>. I do have to say that the moments at apogee on that contraption are: almost heart stopping. :-)
