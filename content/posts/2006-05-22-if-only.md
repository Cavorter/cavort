A friend sent along [a link to an LJ post](http://odditycollector.livejournal.com/97166.html) where someone did what they thought covers of three prominent DC comics would look like if the male characters where treated the same visually as the female characters usually are. I think it illustrates the point nicely. Quite possibly not work safe.
