At this point I think the inherent advantage of acquiring recorded music solely through the means of traveling to a brick and mortar storefront, perusing the incredibly over complicated system to locate likely albums that I might like to purchase, physically bringing the stack of shiny plastic to the cashier with my own hands and whatever other means I can come up with in the moment, watching as each barcode or price sticker is laboriously tallied, and finally handing over a suitable bundle of paper or small plastic card which may or may not be returned with a large bag containing the shiny plastic I took such pains to collect is that is is not an easy process. I have to have the time and energy to get the store. I have to have enough patience to be able to defeat whatever myopic intelligence designed the system to hide the items that I want from me. Most importantly I have to think about the entire process as I go through it which makes me more likely to think about things like, "Can I afford this?".

It is that last bit that worries me the most with [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com)'s new [MP3 Download service](http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/163856011/ref=topnav_storetab_dmusic/104-3548441-1734339). So far I've only purchased three albums and I wonder if that isn't just the taste that I need to go wildly into debt if I don't keep my wits about.

I have experimented with various music download services at various points and had highly varied experiences with the multitude of them. There is something about the simplicity of Amazon's execution of the concept that has finally gotten through to me that this is really finally possible.

It certainly has it's downsides. It currently only runs on Windows, not that I run anything else right now and by the same token it should not actually be too difficult for them to port their client application to just about any OS given how simple it is. Relatively small selection of "only" 1 million tracks (or there abouts) which sounds like a lot but really means that only a small number of the many songs that you might want to buy may be available. Still has a couple of quirks being fairly early in beta though there has already been one client update since release which fixed the only problem that I've run into personally.

About that problem: As I mentioned I have purchased three albums from the service. [The Cinematic Orchestra's "Motion"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/ays/organize.html?asin=B000QZSMZ4&#038;viewShared=0&#038;targetCustomerId=A3FVGMJE8FLSP6), [Skalpel's self titled album](http://www.amazon.com/gp/ays/organize.html?asin=B000QZSTFW&#038;viewShared=0&#038;targetCustomerId=A3FVGMJE8FLSP6), and [Sufjan Stevens' "Illinois"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/ays/organize.html?asin=B000S56R1I&#038;viewShared=0&#038;targetCustomerId=A3FVGMJE8FLSP6) which turned out to be my first and only cause to contact Amazon's tech support. I initially sent an email message through their web interface but did not get any reply after 30ish hours so I used the web interface to have them call me (neat trick) and talked to someone very nice who couldn't quite help me because the tech support for the download service wasn't quite open for business at 7:30AM CST on a Tuesday. When I finally called them a half hour later a very nice person fairly immediately re-authorized the download links for me and I was able to finally get the album and I've been listening to the audio CD I burned immediately all day since. Turns out the new client was likely the reason why I could download the album this time, though neither I nor the tech support guy had any good reason why that might be so. I suspect it has something to do with the rather whimsical and extensive names given to the tracks of this particular album since they've been giving some of my other applications some trouble too.

Some of the people who might read this might think that having trouble with one third of my purchases so far is a good example of how new and untried the service is, but I would actually say quite the opposite. The first attempt was utterly perfect and gave me good reason to try it two more times. The client setup is relatively painless, even in Vista with UAC enabled, and the neat little touch of automatically adding the downloads to my iTunes library meant that I could start listening immediately without having to go look for what the client had done with the files. I'm a savvy enough computer user that really that isn't actually a problem for me, especially given how difficult it can be from other services, but not having to worry about little details like that makes me really think this is ready for everyone, not just those who sometimes wander over near the bleeding edge.

Supposedly they are marking the downloaded files so that if the files show up on a P2P network later they know where they came from, but I'm not honestly worried about that since I don't participate in any of that. Otherwise they are pure MP3 files with appropriately pre-populated tags and even embedded cover art. I can, and have, used them any of the multitude of places that I use mp3 files.

I honestly think this is finally it. Give it a try.
