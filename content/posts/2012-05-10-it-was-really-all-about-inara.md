There was a minor kerfuffle this past week about LEGO declining to produce a model based on the Serenity spaceship from the TV series Firefly. I would link to the project page but it has already been removed from the site. Suffice it to say that the project did reach 10,000 supporting votes, the minimum required for The LEGO Group to officially consider the proposal for a production release. However [LEGO declined to continue the project](http://legocuusoo.posterous.com/congratulations-to-the-firefly-serenity-plays).

I will say that I am not particularly surprised that LEGO declined to produce the set. It was a long shot in the first place, especially given that [they responded similarly for the Winchester building from Shaun of the Dead](http://legocuusoo.posterous.com/results-of-the-lego-review-for-the-winchester) and later provided [a clarification of their stance on incorporating other brands into their product line](http://legocuusoo.posterous.com/brand-standards-what-makes-an-appropriate-leg). From a corporate standard it actually does make some sense: LEGO is attempting to manage their image to affiliate it with childhood, toys, and to some extent naivete. That's their choice and it's not an unreasonable one even if I don't always agree with all of their decisions.

However it was this morning on Twitter that I saw what is apparently the specific reason that the Serenity model was rejected: Sex. Here's the relevant tweets.

{{< tweet 200334734457442305 >}}
{{< tweet 200336248995446785 >}}

So it wasn't the violence, as should be fairly obvious given their enormously successful Star Wars line of products, it was all about the sex. That Inara is un-apologetically in the sex industry means that LEGO can not associate themselves with the entire brand. Well, at least those tweets were fairly honest.
