**Recipe Number**: 1.0<br/>
**Batch Number**: 1<br/>
**Stage**: Carbonation<br/>
**Elapsed Time**: 182 hours

I had opened bottle #2 earlier in the week and it had still not been at all carbonated so I decided to just let it sit for a few days, then the household got pretty sick for most of the week and then busy, and so finally on Saturday I opened bottle #3 and there was carbonation. Still pretty light though. The smell is about the same and definitely off putting for drinking, even though the actual flavor is definitely drinkable. So, the result? I could drink this stuff if I had to, but thank goodness I don't have to. I dumped the rest of the batch and I think I'll try putting down a batch of ginger ale later this week and see how that goes.
