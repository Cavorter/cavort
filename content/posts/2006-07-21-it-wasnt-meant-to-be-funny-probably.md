    Michael J. Nelson from the now gone MST3K has a new gig, but doing the same old thing. <a href="http://www.rifftrax.com">RiffTrax</a> are audio commentaries that you play on your portable media player while watching a particular movie.
  
  
  
    It's not _quite_ an original idea, since it is basically like the <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/">commentary podcast that is put up for Battlestar Galactica episodes</a>. The differences are two-fold: These won't end up on the movie DVD, and in theory they're funny.
  
  
  
    Still, it's a good enough reason to put <a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=60026347&#038;trkid=189530">"Road House"</a>, the only track available right now, in my Netflix queue. Given the way the poll on their site is going however, it looks like <a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=20557937">"The Matrix"</a> may just be next.
