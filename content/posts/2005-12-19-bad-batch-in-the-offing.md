I opened a bottle of the African Skies after 55 hours of carbonating and 2 hours chilling, and it was not a good thing. It wasn't quite a bad thing either, but definitely not a good sign so far. There was barely any pressure release when opened, and the liquid was essentially flat. Very strong yeast smell and taste. Nothing really off that I could pinpoint, but not good so far.

I think I might have to do something about the temp where the cases are carbonating. I have them under a blanket near, but not next to, a radiator and my thermometers I use to monitor things are showing a constant 65F. I might need to tweak it up a few degrees, maybe move them closer to the radiator and let them go another day or 2. Hopefully the bottle of root beer I pulled at the same time this morning turns out better.
