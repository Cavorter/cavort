<a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/11/15/ecyclingevent/">According to MPR</a> there is a major opportunity to recycle a lot of old electronics and other household waste this weekend at the Mall of America. I'm going to drop off a bunch of the things that I have listed on the <a href="http://www.cavort.org/take-my-stuff-please/">Take My Stuff! Please! page</a> so if you want anything in particular say something now.
