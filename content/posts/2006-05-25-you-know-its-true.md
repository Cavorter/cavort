[BevNet's](http://www.bevnet.com) new [BevBlog](http://www.bevnet.com/bevblog) has [a theory on energy drink flavors](http://www.bevnet.com/bevblog/2006/05/theory-on-energy-drink-flavors.html) that has more than an inkling of truth to it.

I personally can't stand any of the "energy" drinks that I've ever tried and basically have just given up on them entirely. Besides, they almost all have too much caffeine for any normal human, much less for those of us who have dropped it completely.
