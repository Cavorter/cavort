    I decided to give the new Zune software package a try today just to see what it's like. Why try the software when I don't have the Zune hardware? iTunes is pretty good software and I've never owned an iPod.
  
  
  
    However I've already run into the first item that makes me wonder about the whole Zune ethos: I can't download the software using FireFox.
  
  
  
    Just try and use the "Download Zune" button from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/meetzune/software" target="_blank">this page</a> in any non-IE browser and <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/meetzune/software/undetected_OS.htm" target="_blank">see how far you get</a>.
  
  
  
    Still going to try it anyway and see how it goes, but that sort of little idiocy starts to leave a bad taste in one's mouth.
