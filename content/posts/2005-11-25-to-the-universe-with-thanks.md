With the house pretty much clean, the roast in the oven, and everything else out of my hands for dinner this afternoon it's nice to take a few minutes to rest and think.

There has been a fairly common tradition with the American holiday of Thanksgiving to talk about all of the things that one is thankful for in their lives.

Normally I don't participate in this tradition since it so often seems like a way to pander to those you want to show off to, and an easy way to screw-up by not mentioning someone that you should have. There is also somewhat of a fallacy that one has to be thankful _to_ some higher being in order for this all to work properly. This year I'm going to make a small exception to that lack of participation because this is a really good opportunity for me to express something that I do not express nearly often enough and I am going to express that to the people who I am most thankful to.

As all, or at least most, of you know this past year has not been an easy one for me but despite that I am thankful that it has been as good as it has. There are so many ways that it could have been so much worse that it really does bring to the front exactly how good my life is, and for that I am thankful as well.

My life would not be as full of ease, joy, happiness, and contentment as it is without everyone that I have ever interacted with, even when that interaction was challenging or even unpleasant. But the interactions with my friends and those who have cared enough to try and be there for me even when I thought I didn't need it are the ones that I truly treasure, and the ones that I am most thankful for as I sit here at the keyboard and try to express what I think and feel so strongly.

To all of those who have helped me at any time,<br /> To all of those who have been honest and forthright,<br /> To all of those who have helped me to be what and who I am,<br /> I have not and may never be able to express just how much I appreciate you for who you are and what you have done for me.

Thanks.

On that note, be safe and enjoy your day however it comes to you.
