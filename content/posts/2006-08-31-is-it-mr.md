    [Listening to: Magoo by Drums and Tuba from the album Mostly Ape]
  
  
  
    I don't think I've posted recently about how much I like the band [Drums and Tuba](http://www.drumsandtuba.com/). I'm reminded of it since the track [Magoo](http://www.disclogic.com/cart.jsp?itemId=29689&sessionID=C4F5FF406AF93E0C184189395D80B9EA) from the album [Mostly Ape](http://cdbaby.com/cd/drumsandtuba3) came up in my usual shuffle mode listening. Finding myself typing in time to the music while writing some code is kind of an odd experience. It is exactly the sort of song that grabs hold of your lizard brain and begins to reprogram you to move and breathe in it's own time until the first horn solo comes through and sets you free to figure out what the hell is going on before the capturing riffs come back just like a fairytale piper to lead you back out of your own head.
  
  
  
    While quite a bit of D&T's music can be quite impenetrable to those who don't like to be challenged in their music listening, this track in particular shows off exactly how well composed, challenging, and yet so incredibly listenable their music can be.
  
  
  
    Experimental? Hell yes. But approachable. Appreciable.
