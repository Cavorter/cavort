Before I got into the shower this morning I figured that I would dispose of the 2 batches of soda that were still remaining in the cases that had failed to carbonate. I checked them 3 times last week, most recently on Friday morning, and they had been the same carbonation level the whole time.

Until today.

The African Skies is just about perfect. Possibly still a touch under carbonated, but the flavor is about right, and what remains of the yeast flavor should dull quickly after a day or two in the fridge.

The root beer on the other hand: Well, I'll be posting pictures later today, but suffice it to say that I just spent the last 40 minutes carefully opening bottles from behind a makeshift blast shield and then cleaning up the entire kitchen. The first bottle I opened left significant spatter <em>behind</em> the refrigerator.

How did it all go from flat to gusher in 4 days? Well, I think it might have been the weather. Starting on Thursday night things started to warm up significantly here in the Twin Cities. Every day since then it's been in the mid to high 30's and I think that made _all_ the difference in the ambient temp in the house.

Obviously I need to rethink my placement for carbonation in cold weather, but I suppose that's the good news. And besides, I still have most of the batch of African Skies to drink now!
