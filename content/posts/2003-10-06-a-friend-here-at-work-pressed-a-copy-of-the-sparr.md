A friend here at work pressed a copy of "The Sparrow" by <a href="http://www.marydoriarussell.info">Mary Doria Russell</a> on me last week. I cracked it on Tuesday night, and finished the last portion last night. I have to say that it is an amazing read, full of humor, thought, and faith. Read a copy if you get the chance, it is not to be missed.



Also, finished up "The Goblin Wood" by <a href="http://www.sfwa.org/members/bell/">Hilari Bell</a> last week. Well worth reading, she writes really great juvies, and I liked her adult novel Navohar as well (Thanks to Elizabeth from <a href="http://www.dreamhavenbooks.com/">Dreamhaven</a> for pointing it out a few years ago).



And now, I'm on to the new <a href="http://www.nealstephenson.com/">Neal Stephenson</a>, <a href="http://www.baroquecycle.com">"Quicksilver"</a> which opens in the way that his books do, and already has me pretty well.



Also of note, though I haven't picked up a copy yet, is the new <a href="http://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/">Terry Pratchett</a> discworld novel, <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/catalog/pratchett/site/books/description.asp?isbn=006001315X">"Monstrous Regiment"</a>.



No rest for the weary, but plenty of good stuff to read.
