A friend here at work pressed a copy of "The Sparrow" by [Mary Doria Russell](http://www.marydoriarussell.info) on me last week. I cracked it on Tuesday night, and finished the last portion last night. I have to say that it is an amazing read, full of humor, thought, and faith. Read a copy if you get the chance, it is not to be missed.

Also, finished up "The Goblin Wood" by [Hilari Bell](http://www.sfwa.org/members/bell/) last week. Well worth reading, she writes really great juvies, and I liked her adult novel Navohar as well (Thanks to Elizabeth from [Dreamhaven](http://www.dreamhavenbooks.com/) for pointing it out a few years ago).

And now, I'm on to the new [Neal Stephenson](http://www.nealstephenson.com/), ["Quicksilver"](http://www.baroquecycle.com) which opens in the way that his books do, and already has me pretty well.

Also of note, though I haven't picked up a copy yet, is the new [Terry Pratchett](http://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/) discworld novel, ["Monstrous Regiment"](http://www.harpercollins.com/catalog/pratchett/site/books/description.asp?isbn=006001315X).

No rest for the weary, but plenty of good stuff to read.
