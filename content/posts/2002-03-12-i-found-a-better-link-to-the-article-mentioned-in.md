I found a better link to <a href="http://www.iisadministrator.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=24422#">the article mentioned in the previous post</a>. I have received a nice response from the author with an invitation to be quoted in piece he's thinking about writing for the next article that would discuss the opposing viewpoints.

One of the things he mentions did jump out at me though was his reaction to the negative feedback. I sounds like he hasn't been doing a lot of editorials yet, or at least not very many that deal with issues as controversial as this.

There are a lot of topics that people get very passionate about and whenever you have a public platform, it really does pay to be able to take the kooks with a couple of grains of salt. With my response, I really tried to dump the bile and invective, but I don't think I was as successful as I had hoped. I can only hope I had one of the more well reasoned responses.
