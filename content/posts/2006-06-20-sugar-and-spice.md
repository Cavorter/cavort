    <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/issue/50">This week's issue of The Escapist</a> is all about women and gaming. Some interesting reading in there. Anyone with more of a feminist bent want to do any commentary? I thought the article about <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/link/2189">the possible myth of male focus in gaming</a> to be especially interesting.
