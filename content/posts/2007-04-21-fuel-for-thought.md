I'm playing around with the publishing features on Google Spreadsheets and thought it would be fun to embed a couple of items from my mileage tracking spreadsheet.

Here's the averages bar, which I use as a kind of dashboard for overall historical information:<br />

I tried to get some of the new charts to publish, but it wasn't working. Then I tried to get a link to a sheet that I made a couple of charts on, and that wasn't quite working either. So, <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pBACX5AiAqhk6404Aj5LcKQ&#038;output=html">go look for yourselves</a> if you're really curious.
