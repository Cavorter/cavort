    For the very few people who do keep up with my site here there may be some downtime over the next few days. I'm moving everything to a remote host for quite a few very good reasons:
  
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      With the plan to finally physically move house this year, moving electronically out of the house early ensures I don't even have to think or worry about what my next broadband connection will and will not allow, to say nothing of the likely gap in service during the move.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reduces my phone/internet expenses by 2/3rds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reduced electrical costs from keeping my servers fired up 24/365.
    </li>
    <li>
      Less environmental noise from fewer boxes running. (The "servers" are even the noisiest so this is kind of a big deal)
    </li>
    <li>
      Less hardware maintenance. The "server" boxes I use are basically all of my older retired machines and many of the parts are <em>way</em> past their MTBF.
    </li>
    <li>
      My current DNS management sucks through <a href="http://www.visi.com">Visi</a>. They have been a really good ISP, but I should not have to send email to support to get a DNS change made when I feel like tinkering with things.
    </li>
    <li>
      Kind of tired of re-learning bits of Linux every six months after I have forgotten most of it in the interim when I'm not having to mess with the systems. Though I am seriously moving my non-gaming machine to Ubuntu to give it a serious try.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  
    I'm sure there are a couple of more that I'm not remembering at the moment but as you can see the list is pretty extensive and while in a lot of ways I'm going to miss doing all of my own hosting of everything the advantages are just too many at this point.
