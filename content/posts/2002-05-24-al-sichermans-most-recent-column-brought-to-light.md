[Al Sicherman's most recent column](http://www.startribune.com/stories/404/2840662.html) brought to light something even more disturbing than colored ketchup. Even more compellingly vile than colored margarine. [Chocolate flavored and electric blue covered oven french fries](http://www.nick.com/ads/oreida).
