So now that I'm not running L-Space I don't have to be running Windows for my server and I should be able to get a configuration that doesn't have the comment posting issues that I've currently got. So today I'm trying out [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org) and [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/) on a couple of test boxes to see how they run. So far, I've loaded up both of them in their "server" default configurations and found out a very interesting thing: I don't have the patience to learn a command line driven OS anymore. It's kind of disappointing, but I just don't feel like I have the impetus to muddle through the command line interface. So now the Ubuntu non-server installer has been running on the test box for quite some time. We'll see how it goes.
