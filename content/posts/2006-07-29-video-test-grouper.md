    Second video test, this time using [Grouper](http://www.grouper.com). Which I think is a really stupid name for a video sharing website.
  
  
  
    Birds<br /> <em>Really fricking annoying embedded video window removed.</em>
  
  
  
    <strong>Update:</strong> Well, the site name isn't the only stupid thing about that site. Embedded video windows have 2 glaring issues:
  
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Windows Media only, so it doesn't work in Firefox
    </li>
    <li>
      After playing the video pointed to, it automatically starts to play something else off the site
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  
    You can see the clip I uploaded [here](http://grouper.com/video/Preview.ashx?id=1462938&#038;ap=1&#038;ex=1&#038;t=1.wmv) if you really want to.
