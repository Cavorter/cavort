    A few of the things that I do think are really very good about the new Zune software are both the Podcast and the social/community support. I have been using services like Last.fm, iLike, and a large variety of others for a very long time now and am really happy to see that kind of support built-in as a basic feature that is incredibly simple to use and visually fairly appealing. So far, in the couple of hours I've been playing around with it, it's wonderful.
  
  
  
    Podcast support also is very well executed. The v2 software was able to use my existing cache of downloaded podcasts to seed the Podcast view and while I did have to do some cleanup and am having some difficulty getting some of the really old stuff integrated into single items in the Podcast list I was able to get up to date with the majority of what I regularly listen to simply by finding the existing item and hitting the "subscribe" button in the interface. I can not say enough positive things about how well this got implemented that it <em>almost</em> makes up for the total absence of support for the past year.
  
  
  
    Oh, and the software is very, very pretty. No really, it's quite nice to look at which is a rarity.
