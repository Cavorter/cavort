    I was looking over the [Star Tribune candidate profiles](http://mpls.startribune.com/news/politics/elections/myvote/pf.php) for the primary tomorrow and thought it was fairly interesting to see that in the [Hennepin County Commisioner&nbsp;District 4](http://www.co.hennepin.mn.us/vgn/portal/internet/hcchannelmaster/0,2324,1273_1728__2,00.html) race there is a [Green Party](http://www.mngreens.org/) candidate ([Farheen Hakeem](http://www.farheenhakeem.org/)) who is running on a [social issues platform](http://mpls.startribune.com/news/metro/elections/profiles/26172.html) and a [DFL Party](http://www.dfl.org/) candidate (incumbent [Peter McLaughlin](http://www.petermclaughlin.org/)) who is running on an [environmental issues platform](http://mpls.startribune.com/news/metro/elections/profiles/26173.html).
