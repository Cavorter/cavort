I was doing some shopping today and ran across three new lines of soda that I had not previously seen. Haven't tasted them all yet, but figured I'd at least mention them here before I forgot.



First up, while I was looking for the new <a href="http://drysoda.com" target="_blank">Dry Soda</a> flavors at <a href="http://www.kowalskis.com" target="_blank">Kowalski's</a> (which they did NOT have) I found <a href="http://www.oogave.com" target="_blank">Oogav√©</a> in Root Beer, Cola, Ginger Ale, and Watermelon Cream. I gave the Ginger Ale a miss this trip but if the other three are decent I'll probably give that one a try as well. It was nice that the Cola was non-caffeinated and it's great to see a different flavor like Watermelon Cream put out by anyone.



On the other side of the aisle in the drink mixers was <a href="http://www.fever-tree.com/" target="_blank">Fever-Tree</a> Ginger Beer. It's diminutive size (200ml/6.8 fl oz) is what really marks it as a drink mixer instead of intended as a typical premium CSD and seems similar in approach to <a href="http://www.fentimans.com/" target="_blank">Fentimans</a> line of smaller bottles for mixing. I do think it's interesting on their website though that they appear to have both Ginger Bear and Ginger Ale flavors.



Later at <a href="http://www.rainbowfoods.com/" target="_blank">Rainbow</a> I saw they were carrying <a href="http://www.bigbaybrewing.com" target="_blank">Big Bay Brewing Company</a> Pierjumper Twisted Citrus and Oh Bouy! Cherry Cola. Unfortunately I skipped the Oh Bouy on the grounds that it might have actual cherry in it which wouldn't do so well for me. (Oh, do I miss cherries:)



Hoping to take a couple of each to a party tomorrow night, so if you see me and want to try one just let me know!
