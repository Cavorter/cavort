Apparently you can have Mr. T (Yes, [<em>that</em> Mr. T](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._T)) [speak your driving instructions](http://navtones.com/tomtom.php) if you have a [TomTom GPS unit](http://www.tomtom.com) that supports "NavTones". He's not the only one: Dennis Hopper, Burt Reynolds, and (newly added) Gary Busey.
