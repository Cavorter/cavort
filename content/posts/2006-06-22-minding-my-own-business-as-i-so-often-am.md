    I know of at least two people who will be interested in this site: [AmigoFish](http://amigofish.com/)
  
  
  
    In their own words:
  
  
  <blockquote>
    
      a way of finding podcasts and videoblogs of interest to you.
    
  </blockquote>
  
  
    I haven't created an account for myself yet, or really done much more that just give it a cursory look, but I ran across a reference to it [via an entry on a geographic BlogNeighbor's site](http://garrickvanburen.com/archive/abstruse-i-am) while doing research for something at work. It was sort of weird realizing that I recognized some things in his flickr stream just a bit too well.
