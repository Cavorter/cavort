    [BevNet has a fairly positive review](http://www.bevnet.com/reviews/drysoda/) up of a new line of sodas with some fairly interesting flavors: Rhubarb, Lavender, Lemongrass, and Kumquat. The brand is called [DRY Soda](http://www.drysoda.com/), and I only wish I could get some locally. With a mixed-case price starting at $25, plus shipping, I think I'm going to have to wait a bit before I get to try it.
  
  
  
    I've actually been thinking that the people behind Snow would do a fabulous job with lavendar flavored soda.
