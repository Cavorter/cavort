I learned something today about my electric bill: The State Taxes are computed on the subtotal and the City Fee rather than just the subtotal. I actually called Xcel Energy to ask about it because there was an apparent extra $0.25 in the State Tax line item and after getting hung up on the first time got someone helpful who figured it out.
