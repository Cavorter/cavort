In the last two weeks I've run into something a little different at two places that I've been for dinner. It appears that both the new <a href="http://www.thechatterboxpub.com/">Chatterbox Pub</a> location in Highland Park and <a href="http://www.signaturecafe.net">Signature Cafe</a> in Prospect Park are serving sodas from <a href="http://www.shamrockgroup.net">The Shamrock Group</a>. So far, the cola and the root beer flavors that I have tried are pretty decent, though nothing stellar. It will be interesting to see if I seem them showing up elsewhere around town, I know the original Chatterbox Pub near my home still has Weinhart's for their root beer.



And while I'm thinking about it, do give the Signature Cafe a try if you have the chance. It's got a very interesting and varied menu and a staff that is: well, friendly doesn't begin to describe it.
