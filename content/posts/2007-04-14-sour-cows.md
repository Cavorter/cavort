    In the category of things that would be a lot of fun to do, but I probably will never get around to actually doing anything about participating in: I've recently found two different races that I've thought it would be fairly entertaining to take part in. Yes, actual car racing, of sorts.
  
  
  
    The first one is actually a reality show on <a href="http://www.spiketv.com">Spike TV</a> called <a href="http://www.bullrun.com/u/page/cGlkPTM/spike_tv">BullRun</a>. I ran across it the first time when they posted the series premiere to the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/marketplace/">Xbox Live Marketplace</a> for free. It's basically a long distance road rally with pretty crazy special stages and a classic reality show elimination system. How could that not be fun? Well, besides the TV cameras and the manufactured drama and etc? Besides, my TDi would beat the pants off of most of the competition in mileage and me and whoever I partnered with (ideally my brother) would only have to make a few modifications to make it competitive in the special stages and unlike the team that got eliminated in that series premiere who also had decent mileage, I can navigate.
  
  
  
    The second one I actually just heard about today and is <a href="http://www.24hoursoflemons.com/">The 24 Hours of LeMons</a> which has the entertaining requirement that the vehicle in each entry must cost less than $500. Plus it has events named things like: Personal-Injury-Lawyer Anti-Slalom, the Marxist-Valet Parking Challenge, and the Wide Open Throttle Rodthrowapalooza. Almost tempting to head to Detroit in September for the second event of the "season".
