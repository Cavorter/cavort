    Something else that I haven't used much lately that is being cut from the budget: World Of Warcraft. Given that I haven't logged in this month yet, I'm not particularly surprised. The last time my 6 month subscription came up this last spring I was sort of getting back into the swing of things. That was pretty short lived, though I did enjoy the bits of [Zul'Gurub](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/zulgurub.html)&nbsp;that I had a chance to see with my old guild.
  
  
  
    While I understand for a lot of people that once you get your character to level 60 there is almost a whole new and different game to play, it's just not a game that I like playing.
  
  
  
    We'll see what happens when the expansion is released this fall. That might finally be enough time and new material to make it interesting enough to go back.
