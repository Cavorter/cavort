So while I was filling up the fuel tank for the first time on my new-to-me 2003 VW Golf GLS TDI, I ended up having to go into the store to pay for the gas. Looks like the modern convenience of the card reader hasn't made it to the diesel pumps yet.

Anyway, while in the store I figured that I'd take a look for anything new and lo and behold they had bottles of Berries & Cream Dr Pepper.

So how is it? Well, it's a lot like Dr Pepper. Seriously. The base flavor is very strongly the classic Dr Pepper flavor, it's just that they've added a bit of something else in there. That something else comes off as a relatively light but additional sweetness and a fairly soft vanilla finish. The Vanilla Coke and Pepsi people could learn something from the vanilla flavor Cadbury Shweppes and Co are using in this. Certainly worth a try, but nothing astonishing and new as far as I'm concerned.

Unfortunately they did not have bottles of the new "100% Natural" 7-Up. That's something that I'm actually looking forward to trying.
