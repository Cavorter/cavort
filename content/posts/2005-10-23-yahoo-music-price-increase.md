Paul Thurrott blogged about a news article that <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/zd/20051021/tc_zd/163289">Yahoo is increasing the price of their Music services</a>. I found it really interesting because that was the first I've heard of it and I'm a subscriber! I'm looking into it, and I'll probably post more info as I find it.
