One of the things that I'm enjoying most about <a href="http://www.chainfactor.com">Chain Factor</a>, besides the incredibly addictive game, is the code hints/easter eggs that you get sometimes that show up as an "error message". Like this one:


<blockquote>

ERROR 003



LEVEL 3 / CODE NNN



* UPPER BOUND FOR BASIC SCORES?<br /> * ok i've got to stop playtesting and start coding. i'm starting to see<br /> * colored discs everywhere i look. do we know the upper limit on<br /> * basic mode scoring? i'm thinking about memory allocation:<br /> * -F



* No we don't. Figuring that out is the players' job.<br /> *<br /> * Here's another to do: find someone in the Minneapolis area to check<br /> * on the OOH which should be up: 494 and hwy 77 - might need some<br /> * searching around.<br /> * /s

</blockquote>


Incredibly fun stuff. Give it a try.



<strong>Update</strong> Finally got error 1 again:


<blockquote>

 ERROR 001



LEVEL 1 / CODE NNN



* MEDIA MATRIX<br /> * s, this printout is unreadable - i'm missing half the entries in the<br /> * locations column:<br /> * -F



* Yes, actually it would be useful if you could go out and confirm that<br /> * these are up:<br /> * LA Century N/L E/O Aviation - should be obvious.<br /> * 1815 Hawthorne 90278 - not sure about this one, you may have to<br /> * look around a bit.<br /> * /s



* can't wait to see your mad media jamming skillz<br /> * -F



* We're going to put Primacy to shame - not just sticking up a few<br /> * posters but appropriating the media machine on a grand scale.<br /> * /s

</blockquote>


<strong>Update 2</strong> Yet another one:


<blockquote>

 ERROR 007



LEVEL 1 / CODE D



* ++Power Outage?++<br /> * F, why is MAX_POWERS set to 1 here, what is this?<br /> * /s



* this is totally the idea, one power, no greys, but garbage starts at<br /> * max frequency - fast and furious, on ly the stong survive!



* This wasn't in the spec. I get the idea, but next time let me know<br /> * before you implement something like this.<br /> * /s



* ok boss.
