These days it seems like just about everyone that I know is doing something on [Live Journal](http://www.livejournal.com). A problem is that I really don't like Live Journal, and it has nothing to do with the basic service, it has everything to do with what happens when people start using it.

I have a relatively well realized rant about why this is, and I'll spare everyone from it now but the core of the problem is that I really do not like clique's and Live Journal seems to facilitate both the formation of clique's incredibly well as well as interaction between clique's which only seems to cause turmoil.

I do know that part of the problem is that I only ever hear about the negative things that are said/happen on Live Journal, but it happens with enough frequency that I really don't like it.

A friend recently brought up the point that I do have a blog, which is much the same thing. At the time I agreed, but I have since figured out what the difference is for me. In Live Journal, other people are able to make comments about your journal directly. When I post something in my Blog, the only way that people comment about it is directly to me. Despite the fact that it's a public display of my thoughts, it feels a lot more private and personal.
