    A friend pointed out to me that a link was dead in one of my posts. Turns out, it's a whole lot more than one of them and comments and pings got turned off for some of the resent posts too. In any case, I'm going back through them and at this point I can, for the most part, blame the current version of WordPress for the issue. It appears that it is adding extra \ characters to all occurances of " and ' characters, which when combined with hyperlinks makes for all sorts of broken crap.
  
  
  
    My apologies, I'm going through past posts right now to fix all the ones I can find.
