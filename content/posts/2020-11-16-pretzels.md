I made pretzels for the first time yesterday! I was expecting them to look like a complete mess and possibly not even identifiable as pretzels but over all I think they turned out pretty good for a first attempt. I used the [Alton Brown recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/homemade-soft-pretzels-recipe-1948242) and it was pretty simple to follow, even though their site is a huge mess.

A couple of notes for next time:
- More oil on the parchment. I know there's going to be some sticking pretty much whatever I do, but "lightly brush" was very clearly not enough.
- Make sure to re-read the baking time sooner rather than later so that the first tray doesn't stay in too long. (Ignore the recipe summary on the site, read the instructions!)
- Let both trays get dark instead of pulling the second one out early. They weren't _quite_ underdone, but the darker ones were slightly better.
