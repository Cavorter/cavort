[Ed Bott](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=68#comments) reports on a new backup option in some versions of Windows Vista that is decidely like Symantec's Ghost utility. The really exciting thing though, is the possibility that the disk images may be in the VHD format that is used by Virtual PC/Virtual Server! It would be so amazingly handy to be able to take an image of your own machine, boot it up in a virtual console and do some tweaking to see how it behaves before applying those changes to your own machine!

This particular implementation of VHD being compatible with Virtual PC/Virtual Server hasn't been confirmed yet that I've heard, but it's a really neat idea.
