I've had a couple of soda floats the last couple of days with pretty good results. First, Olipop Banana Cream (Review coming soon) is excellent with both vanilla and chocolate ice cream. Well, if you like chocolate ice cream, which I don't. However the person in the household who did his that way reported general excellence. Second, [Pepsi Nitro Vanilla](https://www.soda.guide/review/nitro-pepsi-vanilla/) with vanilla ice cream was also quite good. The head was even more creamy than expected, though there was much less of it than I had been thinking there might be. I suppose it was probably just more dense.

[Izzy's Vanilla and Chocolate ice creams](https://www.izzysicecream.com/) used for all floats. YMMV with other brands. :-)
