How to possibly reduce the incidence of catastrophic carbonation: Adjust the recipe to include a set amount of consumable sugar for the yeast to activate, then sweeten with left-handed sugars (usually known as sucralose).

This would essentially make it a "diet" soda, but it should not taste any different than if you had used an equal amount of granulated sugar (beet or cane). [Splenda](http://www.splenda.com/) is the currently marketed version of this, though I'm sure there are other suppliers. I didn't know this previously, but granulated Splenda also contains MultoDextrose, so it might even improve the body of the soda in some ways.
