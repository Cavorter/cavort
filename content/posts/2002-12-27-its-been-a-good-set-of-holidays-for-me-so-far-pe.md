It's been a good set of holidays for me so far. People have gotten me some really interesting stuff that I'm looking forward to making some use of.

Betsy's dad found a book of water tower photographs from all over western Europe and the US that it just astonishing. He also got me a bot kit that I think will be lots of fun to tinker with.

My parents replaced my poor cracked old vintage flower/sugar bins with some really nice somewhat more modern yet still classic looking aluminum bins. I think they'll look fantastic in the kitchen as soon as I figure out where to put them.

Then there's the item that got me the most fired up: Betsy got me a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1580170528/qid=1040998356/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-5493990-8123067?v=glance&#038;s=books&#038;n=507846">"Homemade Rootbeer, Soda, and Pop" by Stephen Cresswell (ISBN: 1580170528)</a> that can also be purchased <a href="http://www.northernbrewer.com/other-books.html">here</a>. Last night after work I went shopping for parts and supplies and I think I've got a good start on the items that I need to get a batch or 3 going. I'm toying with the idea of a new blog dedicated to just my brewing journal, but we'll see what happens.
