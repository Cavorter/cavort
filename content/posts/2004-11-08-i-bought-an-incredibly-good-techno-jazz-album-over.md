    I bought an incredibly good techno-jazz album over the weekend: [Saint Germain des Pres Cafe II](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:4qo7gjtr36i9~T20). It's a compilation of various French techno-jazz pieces, and some of them are incredibly good. If you've heard any of the Hotel Cotes compilations, or like St Germain, you need to hear this.
