L-Space was a BBS based on the pretty good Webadel software by someone I know. It was a public board that ran from sometime in 2000 until May 22, 2006 when it was shut down permenantly for various reasons, though not without some regret. If you are looking for any information about the BBS, feel free to contact me directly and I would be glad to answer any questions that I can. I can state that the message board was always a transient one, and so only some of the message base was ever saved and most of that is not accessible to the general public.

I posted a copy of the announcement that I was shutting it [down on this blog.](/2006/05/15/change-happens/).
